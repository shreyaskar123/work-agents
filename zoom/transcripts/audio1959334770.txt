Recording in progress. Okay, we're starting. So here we go. So I think what we should do is, you know how people like lose their pets and then like put up pet missing photos? I think we should just like put webcams everywhere and then like scrape those videos to like find people's lost pets by just having a camera on every single street. What do you think about that? Ooh. Interesting. Have you considered the privacy implications of that? Let's think about the coding implications, shall we? I think that's the most important part. We should think about the money implications. Yeah, we need the algorithm. So, yeah. So how would we write this algorithm, Barun? You know what? I think that's a great idea. So basically how you would write this algorithm is basically you wanna essentially keep cameras everywhere on every single street. Very legal of us. Yeah. Then you use the computer widget to identify any moving object that resembles like a cat or a dog or whatever they're looking for right here. And then if we see something that looks like that, we can minimize our possibilities of where it might possibly be. And then we will hopefully be able to identify where this missing dog went. And hopefully if it's still alive, then like we'll be able to return it to the owner and everything will be right in this world. How did that sound? Yes. And we need to build a secret database of every single pet any camera sees so that we can identify them. Hmm. I like that. I like that. Yeah. Any ethical things that we have to consider or nah? Nah, nah. I mean, the cameras might look ugly. That's true. That's the main thing I was thinking of. Yeah. You know what? We're gonna have to like think about that. We're gonna make the cameras look really nice. Like less invasive. People don't know that they're being watched. That's- Yeah. That definitely helps with the ethics. Cool. Good meeting friends. Oh, good meeting. Thank you. Nice meeting you.
