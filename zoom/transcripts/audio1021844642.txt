Okay, recording in progress. Hello section ease so. For today's assignment, hello, welcome to section for today's assignment. We're going to create something called cryptography, so here's how we're going to do it. We're going to create Python code and we're going to break this down into helper functions. The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to have something compute slug that takes in a string and we're going to make a list which functions as a slug for the encryption. Then we're going to have a helper function which encrypts characters based on a source and a slug. And then we're also going to have a function that encrypts strings and one that decrypt strings. Again, based on the source and slug. And the final thing we have to do is write encrypt file and decrypt file which are functions that call on encrypt string and decrypt string to an entire files to. Finalize the our code and then of course we also need to write a main function which can call upon all of these helpers and run our code. How are you feeling about the assignment? That sounds good. Could you go a little bit more into depth about like slug key? The first part? I'm just a little bit confused on what to use and like what specific examples I could like reference here. Sure, so basically what it does is you input a string and it goes through that string and basically for each letter it finds an order. It puts it into the slug, which is a list, and once it's finished going through the string I then picks all the letters that aren't already in the slug and put them in one by one. An alphabetical order. OK, so what if we have like repeats and letters? If you have repeats and letters in the key, that only takes the first copy of the letter. Similarly, when it goes through the alphabet, if there's a character that's already in the slug, and so it's in the key, it doesn't put it back in. So the length should be exactly 26 characters. OK, cool. Could you give me like one example? Just so that like I'm super clear about it. Sure, so if the input word is bananas, it'll give us a list that is B, A, N, S, and then goes through the rest of the alphabet. So C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and so on. OK, OK, that's super helpful. I can start like coding that up like ASAP. I'll get it to you by like tomorrow-ish. But yeah. Yay! OK, you've got this. I believe in you. Goodbye, Section E's. Bye, guys.
