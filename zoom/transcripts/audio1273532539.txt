Hi everybody, my name is Shreyas and I'm the CEO of this startup, and this is what we really want to do in our company. So what we're going to do is we're going to build a GUI that where we can give text as input. And click a button. And then this is the main part is that we will have a bunch of quantitative and qualitative analysis of the text with various authors including Shakespeare, Plato, and so forth. So include as many as you can. We need to make sure that the server analysis is of course grounded in science. It's very scientific. We want to also be very detailed in our analysis. So that's what our project is about. And, you know, I have investors to talk to so we're in a tight deadline. So engineers, I want you guys to quickly finish this product as soon as possible. Thanks everybody and get to work. Bye guys. So say we have something.
