or like a graph, recording in progress, or maybe we could do like someone's screen shares, we could try to analyze the screen share. Yeah, perfect. So guys, what idea do you want to make? Okay, so this time, what if we created a model that can basically, basically, we want to create this AI agent, right, that takes your zoom meetings, and then it's like, whoa, do you want to send a communication? Or do you want to send like, do you want to start writing code, right? And then from there, we decide like what code to write, and we create tests, and we create the code itself. And then we keep on working to refine this through machine learning model, and keep on working to refine this until our code actually works. And if there's any questions, our agent will also send a question to our employer right there. How does that sound guys? I've never heard of an idea like that. That's kind of crazy, Roo. I think that should be implemented. Yes. Bye guys.
