Alex: So we're tasked with getting this snake from one corner to the other in an n*n grid. It sounds a bit tricky considering the snake can move and rotate, but there are also blocked cells.

Jordan: Right. It's almost like navigating a maze where you not only have to find a way through but also manipulate your shape to fit through certain areas.

Alex: Exactly. Let's start by thinking about how we can represent the snake's movement. Moving right or down seems straightforward, but the rotations add a layer of complexity.

Jordan: For sure. I think we might need to keep track of the snake's orientation somehow. That way, when we're checking for possible moves, we can also check if a rotation is possible based on its current orientation and the cells around it.

Morgan: And considering we need to find the minimum number of moves, it looks like a job for some sort of breadth-first search algorithm where we explore all possible moves from a given state.

Alex: That makes sense. We'll probably need to keep some sort of data structure to track the states we've already visited to avoid going in circles. Each state could include the snake's position and orientation.

Jordan: True. And when we're exploring moves, we could push the new state onto our queue with a move count incremented by one, comparing it to the current least if we have one.

Morgan: About checking whether a move is possible, we need to be careful. Just because a cell is zero doesn't mean the snake can move there. We have to ensure the whole snake fits without overlapping into any ones.

Alex: Right, so for a horizontal move, we check the cell directly to the right of its head. But for rotating, we need to check both cells either below or to the right, depending on the current orientation.

Jordan: Exactly. And if we reach the bottom right corner with the snake in the right position, we compare the move count to find the minimum.

Morgan: What about when we encounter obstacles? I guess we'll need some logic to decide when it's best to rotate or just try a different direction.

Alex: It'll be iterative, I guess. If a move is blocked, we try another. If all possible moves from a current state are blocked, that path is a dead end, and we backtrack.

Jordan: The hardest part seems to be effectively representing and tracking the state so we don't revisit the same scenarios unnecessarily.

Morgan: Definitely. And optimizing it so we're not just brute-forcing every possible move combination. There's definitely a balance between exploring possible moves and keeping track of our path efficiently.

Alex: Right. Let's code up a prototype based on this. We can refine our approach as we encounter issues. Does anyone have any specific questions on the mechanics or should we dive into coding?

Jordan: I think I'm clear on the overall strategy. Once we start implementing, we'll probably need to clarify certain details, but for now, I'm good.

Morgan: Agreed. Let's get started.
