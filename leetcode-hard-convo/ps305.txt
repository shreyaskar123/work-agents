**Mia**: Hey, everyone. So, I was thinking about how we can approach this problem of cutting the pizza into pieces such that each piece has at least one apple. We've got a matrix to represent our pizza, and we need to figure out the number of ways to make `k` cuts. Any initial thoughts?

**Alex**: Well, first off, it looks like a dynamic programming problem to me. We need to keep track of the ways to cut the pizza at each step, ensuring every piece has at least one apple.

**Jordan**: I was thinking along the same lines. Maybe we can start by figuring out how to check if a piece of pizza has at least one apple. Isn't there a way to precompute that to make our checks more efficient?

**Mia**: Definitely, we could use a prefix sum or something similar to quickly see if a segment of the pizza has apples. That way, we don't need to check every cell every time we make a cut.

**Alex**: Exactly, a 2D prefix sum could work. For any rectangular piece of the pizza, we can quickly look up how many apples are in it. But, how do we apply dynamic programming here?

**Jordan**: For the dynamic programming part, we might need a state that represents our current position and the number of cuts left. The trick would be defining a state transition that accurately reflects moving from one state to another, accounting for both vertical and horizontal cuts.

**Mia**: Right, and for each state, we're trying to answer: "How many ways can we cut this remaining pizza into `k` pieces such that each piece contains at least one apple?" Our base case would be when we have one piece left and need to check if it's valid.

**Alex**: We also have to ensure that when we're making a cut, every piece before the last piece has at least one apple. We can't just cut anywhere; the cut has to result in valid pieces on both sides.

**Jordan**: And about every time we make a decision—whether to cut vertically or horizontally—we'll essentially be branching our possibilities, right?

**Mia**: Yes, that's a critical point. For each position, we need to explore both directions of cuts, but only in ways that lead to valid partitions of the pizza. It gets more complex as we need to iterate through possible cut positions.

**Alex**: One thing we haven't touched on is how to deal with the modulo 10^9 + 7 part. 

**Jordan**: Ah, that's usually straightforward in dynamic programming problems. Every time we're about to add ways together, we just take the modulo to keep our numbers within bounds. It helps prevent overflow issues with large numbers.

**Mia**: Sounds like we have a decent starting point. We'll need an efficient way to check for apples, a dynamic programming approach to explore all valid cutting paths, and careful handling of our state transitions to keep track of the number of ways.

**Alex**: Agreed. The last piece of the puzzle is coding it in a way that's efficient enough to handle the size constraints given in the problem.

**Jordan**: Let's sketch out some pseudocode and start breaking down the problem into functions. We can tackle the prefix sum array, the dynamic programming memoization setup, and the cut exploration logic as separate pieces.

**Mia**: Perfect, let's start with that and regroup once we have some code to discuss. We might need to optimize further once we see how it performs with larger inputs.
