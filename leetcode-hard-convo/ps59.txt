**Alex**: Hey Jordan, have you started looking into that project with the `m x n` binary grid?

**Jordan**: Yeah, I've been thinking about how to find the minimal total travel distance for all the friends to meet up. It's quite an interesting problem, like figuring out the central meeting point to minimize travel.

**Alex**: Right, it's all about reducing the Manhattan Distance for everyone. For example, imagine if three friends live at points (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2), it’s not immediately obvious where the best meeting point is without calculating.

**Jordan**: True, intuitively, it feels like it should be somewhere in the middle. I guess for the Manhattan Distance, we're talking about the sum of the absolute differences in their x and y coordinates, right?

**Mia**: Exactly, Jordan. You just sum up the distances in the x direction and the y direction separately. It’s quite straightforward once you break it down. But finding that point seems tricky without just brute-forcing every possible meeting spot.

**Alex**: Brute force would indeed work, especially on smaller grids, but imagine scaling up to a 200x200 grid. That approach seems inefficient.

**Jordan**: So, we're looking for a more optimal way? I recall there's a mathematical way to find a central point, minimizing total distance...

**Mia**: Right, focusing on medians might be key here. Without giving the entire game away, let’s say that finding the median positions of all friends’ homes could significantly simplify the problem.

**Alex**: That's a great hint, Mia. So, to consolidate our thoughts, we first identify all the friend's positions along both x and y axes, and then...?

**Jordan**: Then possibly sort those positions? Since we brought up the median, it sounds like sorting could help isolate the central points more quickly.

**Mia**: Precisely, and remember, the Manhattan Distance makes this approach viable because of how it separates the x and y coordinates. 

**Alex**: This makes sense. Once we have the medians, we could theoretically calculate the total distance from those points to each friend's house, right?

**Jordan**: Sounds like a plan. And the beauty is in how scalable this approach is. Instead of iterating across the entire grid, we're just dealing with the coordinates of the friends' houses.

**Mia**: Exactly, it streamlines the process. Just ensure you're considering the odd and even counts of friends differently when calculating the median.

**Alex**: Good point about the median calculation, Mia. This certainly puts us on the right track without just handing us the answer.

**Jordan**: I appreciate this chat; it’s clarified the approach for me. I'll start drafting some code and see how this idea performs with actual data.

**Mia**: Looking forward to seeing what you come up with, Jordan. Remember, the elegance of the solution often lies in understanding the properties of the problem at hand.

**Alex**: Agreed. Let’s touch base again after testing the algorithm. This has been a productive discussion.
