**Ava**: Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining the meeting today. So, we’re tasked with figuring out how to distribute `n` candies into `k` bags, ensuring each bag has at least one candy. And we need the total number of ways this can be done, considering the constraints provided.

**Jordan**: Right, it sounds like a combinatorial problem to me. First off, we need to understand that the candies are unique, which means the order we place them in matters for differentiation but not within the bags themselves.

**Morgan**: Makes sense. So, to start, for two bags, it’s relatively straightforward. We can manually count the ways for small values of `n` to get a feel for the pattern.

**Ava**: Exactly, Morgan. Let’s say `n` is 3 and `k` is 2. The possible ways were three, as in the example provided. It’d be good to look for a mathematical or algorithmic approach to scale this up to larger numbers, considering we need this to work up to `n` being 1000.

**Jordan**: Considering the constraints and how the numbers can grow really large, we might have to use a dynamic programming approach to avoid recalculating scenarios we've already encountered.

**Morgan**: So we’d likely need some kind of a table or matrix to keep track of our calculations as we go. Maybe something that iterates over each scenario of distributing candies amongst bags?

**Ava**: Right, and we should consider every time we place a candy in a bag as a unique state. This way, we could essentially build up our solution from the bottom, starting with fewer candies and fewer bags.

**Jordan**: Also, don’t forget about the modulo `109 + 7` part. With such large numbers, we’ll need to apply the modulo operation to our result to prevent integer overflow.

**Morgan**: Absolutely, and applying the modulo operation at strategic points in our calculation should help maintain accuracy. 

**Ava**: Now, regarding implementation - we should probably start by defining our base cases clearly, right? For instance, if we only have one bag, there’s only one way to distribute any number of candies.

**Jordan**: Definitely, those base cases will be crucial. And from there, we can incrementally increase both candies and bags, calculating each step based on previously calculated steps.

**Morgan**: It seems like a good approach. I’ll start drafting some pseudo-code based on this conversation. We’ll need a function that takes `n` and `k` as inputs and returns the total distribution possibilities, modulo `109 + 7`.

**Ava**: That sounds like a plan. I think with a bit of brainstorming and coding, we can crack this problem. Let’s regroup after some initial coding to discuss any hurdles or optimizations, keeping in mind time and space complexity.

**Jordan**: Agreed. I’ll look into optimizing our dynamic programming solution, maybe even finding a way to reduce space usage if possible.

**Morgan**: Great, looking forward to what we come up with. This is going to be an interesting challenge.

**Ava**: Alright, let’s do this. We’ll touch base soon with updates on our progress. Thanks, everyone, for the productive discussion.
