**Alice**: Hey everyone, thanks for coming together on this. We're looking at a text justification problem today. Our goal is to figure out a way to format text given an array of words and a maxWidth parameter.

**Bob**: Right. So we're focusing on ensuring each line is exactly maxWidth characters wide, adjusting the spacing between words as necessary. Is that correct?

**Alice**: Exactly, Bob. And we'll be applying a greedy approach to fill each line with as many words as possible first, before adjusting the spacing.

**Charlie**: I remember something about handling the spaces. Isn’t it something about distributing them as evenly as possible among the words on a line?

**Alice**: That’s spot on, Charlie. If the spaces can't be evenly distributed, the extra spaces should go on the left side. Except for the last line, which is left-justified with no extra spacing between words.

**Diana**: Oh, the examples given earlier illustrate that well. For instance, having to align "This is an example of text justification." with a maxWidth of 16 shows exactly how the spacing adjustments work.

**Bob**: Right, and with “acknowledgment” in one of the lines by itself, it's clear that if a single word ends up on a line because it's too long, it's just left-aligned with the remaining space at the end. That was from the second example.

**Charlie**: What about the algorithms or methods we might consider to implement this? Any specific approaches in mind?

**Alice**: We'd likely start by iterating over the words, trying to fit as many as we can into a line until adding another word would exceed the maxWidth.

**Diana**: So, it’s about calculating the length of words and spaces as we go. Then, once we’ve reached or exceeded maxWidth, we work backwards to adjust the spacing?

**Bob**: Exactly, Diana. And identifying when we’re on the last line is crucial since it’s treated differently. We only justify the text to the left and avoid extra spacing.

**Charlie**: For handling the even distribution of spaces, we might need to think about some kind of division or modulus operation, right? To distribute the extra spaces as needed.

**Alice**: Precisely. A modulus operation could help us figure out how to distribute the remainder spaces after dividing them evenly.

**Diana**: Sounds like we need to keep track of a few things as we iterate: the current line length, the words in the current line, and how to adjust spaces once we're ready to finalize and add the line to our output.

**Bob**: And there's also the case management for when a word is longer than the maxWidth. We need to ensure our solution is robust enough to handle any input according to the constraints given.

**Charlie**: Do we have all we need to start sketching out a potential solution or maybe write some pseudocode?

**Alice**: I think we do. Let's start drafting, keeping our discussion points in mind. We can refine as we go.

**Diana**: Agreed. Let’s dive in and see how we can bring these ideas to life through code.

**Bob**: I’m ready. This is going to be an interesting challenge to tackle together.

**Alice**: Perfect, let's get to it then. Thanks, team!
