**Eliza:** Hey, Jordan and Sam, I stumbled upon this intriguing problem where a knight needs to rescue a princess trapped in a dungeon. I thought it'd be a fantastic scenario to discuss since I'm a bit stuck.

**Jordan:** Sounds like a classic dilemma! Firstly, how is the dungeon laid out?

**Eliza:** It's a 2D grid setup with `m x n` rooms. The knight starts in the top-left room, and the princess is in the bottom-right one. The rooms contain demons, magic orbs, or they could be empty.

**Sam:** Interesting. So the knight loses health in rooms with demons and gains health with magic orbs. Is there a specific strategy he must follow?

**Eliza:** Yes, the knight can only move rightward or downward to reach the princess as quickly as possible.

**Jordan:** That makes sense. What about the knight's health? How do we calculate when he's in danger or if he has enough health to proceed?

**Eliza:** He starts with a certain health point, and the goal is to figure out the minimum initial health required for him to rescue the princess without dying. The interesting bit is he dies if his health points drop to `0` or below at any point.

**Sam:** It sounds like we need to work backward, considering the worst-case scenario in the princess's room and then seeing what's the minimum health the knight needs at each step to survive until that point.

**Jordan:** Exactly, working backward seems logical because we know the exact conditions for survival in the last room. How do we handle rooms with different conditions, like demons and magic orbs?

**Eliza:** That's where I'm stuck. We need a way to calculate the impact of each room on the knight's health and ensure he arrives at the princess's room with at least 1 health point.

**Sam:** Maybe we should consider dynamic programming? We could create a 2D DP table mirroring the dungeon layout, tracking the minimum health required to reach the princess from any given room.

**Jordan:** Right, the DP table would help us break down the problem into smaller, manageable components, where each cell represents the minimum health needed to proceed from that point.

**Eliza:** So each cell in the DP table would depend on its right and down neighbors since the knight can only move in those directions.

**Sam:** And don't forget, if the knight encounters a room with a demon, the required health increases. Conversely, in a room with a magic orb, the required starting health could be lower.

**Jordan:** This sounds like a plan. We need to ensure the knight's health is always at least 1 in every room, considering all possible paths and optimizing for the minimum starting health.

**Eliza:** I'll sketch out the DP formulation based on our discussion. Thanks, guys, this brainstorming was super helpful. Now, it's about fine-tuning the details and coding it up!

**Sam:** Anytime! Excited to see how you tackle it, Eliza. Remember, test it on different dungeon layouts to ensure your solution is robust.

**Jordan:** Absolutely, testing is key. Looking forward to hearing about your victorious knight and rescued princess saga, Eliza!
