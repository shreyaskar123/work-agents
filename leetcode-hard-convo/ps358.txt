**Alex**: Hey team, I've been thinking about how to approach the problem of converting an integer array into a mountain array by removing the minimal number of elements. Any thoughts?

**Jordan**: Interesting challenge. First off, we need to fully grasp what a mountain array is. Based on what I understand, it's an array that goes up to a peak and then strictly decreases, right?

**Casey**: Correct, Jordan. And importantly, the array should have at least three elements to qualify as a mountain. So, we're looking for a peak in the array after which elements strictly decrease.

**Alex**: Right. So, if I understand correctly, our goal here would be to find the longest increasing subsequence up to a point (the peak), and then the longest decreasing subsequence from that point onwards?

**Jordan**: Exactly, Alex. However, the trick lies in ensuring that those subsequences are strictly increasing or decreasing and that they share a common peak.

**Casey**: One way to think about it could be to analyze the array from both ends. We could calculate the longest increasing subsequences for each element from the start and similarly the longest decreasing subsequences from the end.

**Alex**: Makes sense. So, if we have those lengths, how do we determine the minimal number of removals to form a valid mountain array?

**Jordan**: It's a matter of finding the peak where the sum of the increasing and decreasing subsequences minus one (to avoid double-counting the peak) is maximized. That sum essentially gives us the length of the longest possible mountain array.

**Casey**: And to get the number of removals, we'd subtract the length of this longest possible mountain array from the total length of the original array.

**Alex**: I see, so it's also crucial that the peak isn't at the beginning or end of the array, meaning both the increasing and decreasing subsequences at the peak must be greater than one.

**Jordan**: Precisely. It's a good point to emphasize. That ensures we have a valid mountain shape.

**Casey**: Do we have any sample questions or specific examples we could walk through to better visualize this approach?

**Alex**: Sure, let's take a hypothetical array: `[2,1,1,5,6,2,3,1]`. Following our discussion, we'd first find the longest increasing subsequences up to each point and then the decreasing ones back from the end.

**Jordan**: Right, and once we have those, we look for the best peak—keeping in mind the conditions that Casey mentioned. In this example, choosing to make adjustments based on maximizing our mountain array length leads us to figuring out the number of elements to remove.

**Casey**: In essence, it's about combining these strategies: understanding the mountain array definition, calculating increasing and decreasing subsequences efficiently, and then applying some logic to find that sweet spot—the peak that gives us the longest mountain without being on the edges.

**Alex**: Got it. So, the approach involves a good mix of dynamic programming for the subsequences and careful logic to ensure the peak's validity. I think I have a clear path forward now. Thanks, Jordan and Casey, for brainstorming this.

**Jordan**: No problem, Alex. It's a neat problem to tackle. Happy coding!

**Casey**: Yeah, excited to see how it turns out. Good luck!
