**Alex**: Hey, folks. Have you had a chance to look at that board puzzle I sent over? We need to figure out the least number of moves to solve it, or return -1 if it’s unsolvable.

**Jamie**: Yeah, I took a look. The trick is to identify the solved state, which is `[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]`, and work our way backwards from any given state, right?

**Casey**: Correct. And remember, the empty square, represented by `0`, can only swap with one of its 4-directionally adjacent tiles. It's almost like those slide puzzles I used to play with as a kid.

**Alex**: Right. So, for each position of `0`, we need to look for its adjacent tiles and see which swaps would lead us closer to the solved state. Now, any ideas on how to track our progress?

**Jamie**: Well, from a coding perspective, we could use a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy. Treating each board state as a node and each swap as an edge between nodes.

**Casey**: That’s a good approach. BFS would help us layer by layer until we reach the solved state, thereby ensuring we get the minimum moves. We also need some way to keep track of visited states.

**Alex**: Yeah, a visited states set makes sense. What about handling unsolvable states? Is there a way we can determine that early on?

**Jamie**: Actually, since we are dealing with a 2x3 board, all permutations of the tiles except one should be solvable due to its parity. The challenge is ensuring our algorithm doesn't loop indefinitely.

**Casey**: So essentially, if our BFS concludes and we haven't reached the solved state, we could safely return -1, indicating unsolvability.

**Alex**: Exactly. What about optimization? With a 2x3 board, we won’t have a huge number of states, but it’d still be best to process smarter, not harder.

**Jamie**: Agreed. Perhaps implementing an intelligent way to choose the next swap based on how close it gets us to the goal could enhance it.

**Casey**: Right, but let's not complicate things too much. The simplicity of BFS and checking each possible move should suffice for the problem's scale.

**Alex**: Got it. So, our plan is to implement a BFS to explore board states by swapping `0` with its adjacent tiles, track visited states, and identify when we've solved it or determined it's unsolvable. Any closing thoughts?

**Jamie**: Just that we need to remember to count our moves and return that count once we reach the solved state or -1 if we've explored all possibilities and didn't solve it.

**Casey**: Sounds like a plan. Once we sketch out the BFS implementation, we should test it with some examples to ensure it behaves as expected.

**Alex**: Agreed. Let's regroup after some initial testing. Great discussion, everyone.
