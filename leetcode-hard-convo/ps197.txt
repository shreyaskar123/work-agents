Alex: Good morning, everyone. Let’s dive into the problem to generate playlists under the given constraints. We need to consider songs being played at least once, and a song can only be played again after 'K' different songs have been played. Any initial thoughts?

Jordan: Morning! To start with, it seems like a combinatorial problem. The constraints give us a unique structure. Each playlist has to begin with 'N' distinct songs because each must be played at least once. How we proceed after that depends on 'K'.

Chris: Right, once we've played those initial 'N' songs, we're free to choose the next song from what's now available. But, if 'K' is greater than 0, it means we can't immediately repeat any song; we have to wait until 'K' others have been played. Basically, the number of choices we have for each subsequent slot in the playlist reduces and then widens again, depending on 'K'.

Alex: Exactly, Chris. Let’s think about calculating the number of possibilities. We could use dynamic programming to solve this, where we break down our problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.

Jordan: Yeah, we should consider the state of our DP table. Perhaps, it could be represented as dp[i][j] where 'i' is the number of unique songs played so far, and 'j' is the total number of songs played. Our target would be dp[N][L], right?

Alex: Spot on, Jordan. For the transitions, we’d have two cases to consider when adding a new song to our playlist: choosing a new song that hasn't been played yet, and choosing a previously played song, given the constraint 'K' allows it.

Chris: That means we’d have to calculate the number of ways to pick a new song as N - i, because 'i' songs have already been played, and for picking an already played song, it would be restricted by 'K'. 

Jordan: And don't forget, for a song to be replayable, we need to have played at least 'K + 1' songs, to begin with, otherwise, it would violate the 'K' constraint.

Alex: Precisely. This translates into multiplying our dp[i][j] by the appropriate factor based on whether we’re adding a new song or repeating one. We also need to handle the modulo 10^9 + 7 due to the potentially large numbers.

Chris: Correct. It's crucial to iterate intelligently over 'i' and 'j', carefully updating our dp table based on these conditions and keeping in mind the mod factor.

Jordan: Finally, once we fill out our dp table according to these rules, dp[N][L] would give us the number of possible playlists, right?

Alex: Indeed, that’s our goal. Remember, the initial condition would be the first 'N' distinct songs, essentially seed values for our DP approach. From there, the problem is about correctly applying the transition logic.

Chris: Makes sense. So, the implementation boils down to setting up our DP table, iterating through the combinations according to our rules, and carefully considering the constraints provided by 'K'.

Jordan: I guess it’s now down to implementing this logic in code. We know what we need to calculate and the conditions under these calculations change. 

Alex: Perfect, let's get to coding then. Once we tackle the dynamics of our approach, we’ll verify it against the provided examples to ensure our solution holds up. Shall we start?
