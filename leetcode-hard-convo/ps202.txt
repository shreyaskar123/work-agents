**Alex:** Alright team, today's challenge is quite interesting. We need to count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of a given string, and as you know, these numbers can get pretty large, so we're working modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Jordan:** That sounds like it involves a lot of combinatorics. Are we talking about any string, or is there a specific set of characters?

**Alex:** Good question. The string can be any set of lowercase letters, so we’ll need an algorithm that’s efficient for strings up to 2000 characters long.

**Charlie:** That length definitely rules out brute force. Calculating all possible subsequences directly would explode exponentially.

**Sam:** Right, we need a dynamic approach, maybe something that builds upon the solution for a smaller substring to find the solution for the entire string?

**Jordan:** I see where you’re going. Like, storing results for substrings and then using those to build up to the whole string?

**Alex:** Exactly, Jordan. And remember, since we only care about distinct subsequences, we’ll need to keep track of which combinations we’ve already encountered.

**Charlie:** Sounds like we could use some sort of data structure to store previously counted subsequences or maybe just their counts?

**Sam:** What about using an array where each index corresponds to a character? We could update it as we go along, so it reflects the last known count of subsequences involving that character.

**Jordan:** So, for each character in the string, we’d calculate the new subsequences it would form when added to all the subsequences we've seen before... Interesting. And what’s our base case?

**Alex:** The empty string is our base, with a count of 1, since the empty subsequence is always a valid answer.

**Charlie:** Then, iterating through the string, we update the counts for subsequences including the current character, right? But wouldn’t this double-count some sequences?

**Sam:** We could adjust for that by subtracting the count that character contributed before. It's like considering the new distinct subsequences it brings to the table this time around.

**Jordan:** And every step must be modulo 10^9 + 7, given the problem's requirement to manage the large numbers.

**Alex:** Precisely. It’s also crucial that we don’t directly store subsequences due to memory constraints. Just the count is sufficient.

**Charlie:** Alright, I think I’m getting the hang of this. By effectively leveraging the history of each character's contributions, we efficiently build up our answer.

**Sam:** Yes, and it’s crucial we carefully structure the iteration to ensure we're always adding new, distinct subsequences. This way, we avoid exponential time complexity.

**Jordan:** Okay, this gives us a solid starting point. We’ll need to carefully code this to handle edge cases, like repeated characters, as seen in the “aaa” and “aba” examples.

**Alex:** Brilliant insights, everyone. Let’s start prototyping this approach and run some tests with both simple and complex strings. Remember, our goal is a robust, efficient solution that scales well with string length.

**Charlie:** Time to get coding then. Let's regroup after some progress and share our findings.

**Sam:** Looking forward to seeing this in action. Counting distinct subsequences smartly is quite the challenge!

**Jordan:** Agreed. Let's tackle this problem head-on. Who knows what other clever insights we might uncover along the way?

**Alex:** Exactly the spirit, team. Let’s dive in and reconvene with some updates soon. Happy coding!
