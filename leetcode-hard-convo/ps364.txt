**Alex:** Alright team, we've got an interesting challenge today dealing with undirected graphs. We need to figure out if there's a path between two nodes where each edge has a distance less than a specified limit. We're provided with an `edgeList` and we have to answer queries based on this.

**Chris:** Interesting! So, essentially, for each query, we need to determine if it's possible to travel from one node to another without exceeding a certain distance threshold on any of the edges we traverse.

**Jordan:** Exactly, Chris. And given the constraints, it looks like we're working with potentially large graphs, so we'll need an efficient solution. How should we approach this?

**Alex:** Well, one approach could be to preprocess the graph somehow. Maybe we could sort the edges or precompute certain paths?

**Chris:** I was thinking along similar lines. Maybe sorting the edge list by distance could help. It might make it easier to only consider edges below the given limit when trying to find a path.

**Jordan:** But we must also keep in mind the possibility of multiple edges between the same nodes. We should only consider the shortest edge in such cases, right?

**Alex:** Good point, Jordan. Filtering out longer edges between the same nodes before we start processing the queries could save us some time.

**Chris:** Once we have the edges sorted and filtered, what's next? Should we traverse the graph using DFS or BFS, keeping an eye on the distance limit?

**Jordan:** Both could work, but considering the nature of the queries, might there be a more efficient way to construct or navigate the graph? Something like Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or a minimum spanning tree algorithm that already respects the distance constraints?

**Alex:** DSU seems promising, especially for checking connectivity under certain constraints. We can progressively union nodes by increasing edge distance and then check if two nodes are connected for each query limit.

**Chris:** That makes sense. We'd start by joining nodes based on the smallest distances and then, for each query, see if the nodes are already connected in a way that respects their limit.

**Jordan:** So for implementing this, we'd iterate over the sorted edges and union nodes until we reach an edge distance larger than the query limit. Then, before moving to the next query, we'd check if the nodes are in the same set, implying a valid path exists.

**Alex:** Right. And for each query, we might need some mechanism to reset or keep track of our unions without interfering with subsequent queries. Maybe we can dynamically adjust our approach based on the query limit order.

**Chris:** This sounds like a solid plan. We'll need to code efficiently to handle the large inputs, especially considering time and space complexity.

**Jordan:** Agreed. Let's also make sure to test our solution on various edge cases to ensure accuracy, especially where there are multiple paths with varying distances.

**Alex:** Excellent points all around. Let's start with a prototype based on these ideas and iterate from there. We can regroup later to discuss our progress and tackle any issues that arise.
