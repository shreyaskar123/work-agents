**Alex**: Okay, team, we have a unique challenge today. We've received a request to design an algorithm that finds the number of ways to restore an array from a string representation of integers without spaces, given that each integer will be in the range `[1, k]`. No leading zeros are allowed in the array.

**Jamie**: That sounds like a classic dynamic programming problem to me. We could approach it by figuring out how to break down the problem into smaller, manageable pieces. Wouldn't that work?

**Alex**: Exactly, Jamie. The key is to look at each position in the string and determine how many ways we can form valid numbers up to that point. The complication comes from our need to respect the `[1, k]` range for each possible integer.

**Kelly**: So, are we talking about iterating through the string and at each step deciding whether to include a digit in the current number or start a new number, keeping track of all valid combinations?

**Jamie**: Right, Kelly. And each time we add a digit, we check if the newly formed number is still within our `[1, k]` range. If it exceeds `k`, we know that path won't yield valid arrays.

**Alex**: Good point. Also, remember we're working with a potentially very long string—up to `10^5` characters. We'll need a way to manage memory efficiently and avoid recomputing solutions for the same subproblems.

**Kelly**: Sounds like a memoization approach could help us there. We could use an array or a hash map to store solutions for subproblems as we compute them.

**Jamie**: And since the problem asks for the result modulo `10^9 + 7`, we’ll need to incorporate that into our addition operations to avoid integer overflow. 

**Alex**: That’s an essential detail. We can't forget to apply the modulo operation every time we add up the number of ways to avoid exceeding integer limits.

**Kelly**: Shall we also consider the edge cases? Like when the string starts with '0' or when `k` is less than 10, affecting our ability to form two-digit numbers?

**Alex**: Indeed, Kelly. Though the problem specifies no leading zeros and a guarantee of `[1, k]` range, we must still be diligent about validating our inputs and accounting for edge cases in our logic.

**Jamie**: Do we need to worry about how the length of `k` affects our iteration limits? For example, if `k` is a two-digit number, we shouldn’t be trying to form three-digit numbers.

**Alex**: Correct, Jamie. The maximum length of the number we try to form at each step should align with the length of `k`. That makes our solution more efficient by avoiding unnecessary checks.

**Kelly**: So to sum up, we're proposing a dynamic programming solution with memoization, careful iteration based on the length of `k`, and modulo arithmetic to handle large numbers. And throughout, we'll need robust checks to ensure valid array formation per the problem's constraints.

**Alex**: Perfect summary, Kelly. Let's get to work on designing this algorithm. We'll need to pay careful attention to the implementation details to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Let's regroup later with our pseudocode and test cases to ensure we've covered all our bases.
