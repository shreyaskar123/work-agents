**Alex**: Alright, team, let's dive into today's puzzle. We have to figure out how many ways even-numbered people can shake hands around a circle without any of the handshakes crossing. This sounds like a combination problem, doesn't it?

**Jordan**: Yeah, it does. The first thing that comes to mind is maybe trying to visualize smaller cases, like with 2 and 4 people, to see if we can find a pattern?

**Casey**: For 2 people, that's straightforward, right? Just one way to do the handshake.

**Alex**: Exactly, Casey. And Jordan, when you increase that number to 4, things get a bit more interesting. The two possible ways mentioned make sense when you think about placing the people in a circle.

**Jamie**: I'm wondering if there's some sort of recursive pattern here. Like, each time you add another pair of people, you have to consider how the new handshakes can fit around the existing ones without crossing.

**Casey**: Oh, that makes sense. It's like for each pair, you'd look at the scenarios where they could either be adjacent or split by others, except without the cross-over.

**Alex**: Correct. It's often helpful to think of these problems in terms of smaller, simpler problems. Imagine if we fix one person's handshake partner. We effectively split the circle into two smaller non-crossing handshake problems, right?

**Jordan**: So, it's like a dynamic programming problem? We break it down into smaller problems and then build up the solution from there?

**Alex**: Precisely, Jordan. We could use an array to store solutions to smaller problems and use it to help calculate solutions to bigger problems.

**Jamie**: I guess the challenge then is figuring out the formula that relates the smaller problems to the bigger ones. Like, how do you combine the solutions of these smaller problems to get your answer for the larger problem?

**Casey**: And considering we need to return the answer mod `10^9 + 7`, we should also be mindful of handling large numbers during our calculations.

**Alex**: Right, Casey. Keeping the calculations manageable is key. It's not just about finding the pattern but also implementing it in a way that's efficient for large numbers of people.

**Jordan**: For a starting point, we might need to think about the base cases, like when `num_people` is 2, to kick off our dynamic programming solution, right?

**Jamie**: Yeah, and maybe work out the formula for combining our smaller solutions. This feels like a good puzzle for a dynamic table or memoization.

**Alex**: Absolutely, team. Let's start by sketching out the problem with small examples, figure out the recursive relationship, and then think about how we can memoize or tabulate the solution to keep it efficient. Remember to keep an eye on how we are going to deal with the modulo aspect as well.

**Casey**: Sounds like a plan. Once we have the formula figured out, translating it into code should be straightforward.

**Jordan**: And as always, let's make sure we're clear on why our solution works, not just that it does. Understanding the underlying principle is key.

**Alex**: Great! Let's get to it then. We have a solid approach. Time to break down this problem and build up our solution.
