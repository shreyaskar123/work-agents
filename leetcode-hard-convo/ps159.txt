**Alex:** So, we've got this task to implement a basic calculator. I've been reading through the requirements. It sounds like an interesting challenge.

**Jamie:** Definitely. It mentions we need to handle non-negative integers and operators like `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/`', and also parentheses.

**Taylor:** Right, and the tricky part might be dealing with those parentheses and maintaining the order of operations. How do you think we should approach this?

**Alex:** Well, generally speaking, when dealing with expressions that include parentheses, a stack can be really helpful. It lets us handle operations in the correct order, especially when expressions get nested.

**Jamie:** Makes sense. We might need two stacks thenâ€”one for the numbers and another for the operators, including the parentheses.

**Taylor:** Yeah, and every time we come across a closing parenthesis, we could start evaluating the expression until we hit an opening parenthesis in the operator stack.

**Alex:** Exactly. But, we also have to remember to deal with operator precedence. Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

**Jamie:** True. Maybe we evaluate the stack each time we're about to push a new operator, comparing precedences. If the current operator has lower or equal precedence, we could perform an operation from the stack first.

**Taylor:** That could work. Also, since the integer division should truncate toward zero, we need to be careful with how we implement the division part.

**Alex:** Right. And regarding the range of intermediate results, I assume we just need to make sure our code doesn't overflow or underflow with the operations.

**Jamie:** Speaking of implementation details, any thoughts on how to handle the expression string? Should we parse it character by character?

**Taylor:** Parsing character by character sounds reasonable. We can iterate through the string, and depending on the character, decide whether to push it to the stack or perform an operation.

**Alex:** Also, don't forget, we need to consider multi-digit numbers in the expression. Not just single-digit numbers.

**Jamie:** Good point. We might need to accumulate digits until we find a non-digit character to form the complete number before pushing it to the numbers stack.

**Taylor:** It seems we've outlined a solid approach. Divide the problem, handle the operators' precedence, use stacks for numbers and operations, take care of parentheses, and pay attention to the division and multi-digit numbers.

**Alex:** Yeah, I agree. We've got a decent plan. Let's start drafting some pseudo-code and divide up the tasks accordingly. How's everyone feeling?

**Jamie:** Ready to give it a shot. Let's do this.

**Taylor:** Yeah, feels like we've got a good handle on this. Let's start implementing.
