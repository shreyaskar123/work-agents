Alice: Hey, everyone, have you had a chance to look into the fascinating problem I shared about decoding messages?

Bob: Yes, it's quite intriguing! It involves converting numeric encodings back to letters with a twist of having a wildcard character '*'. It definitely adds an interesting layer to the challenge.

Charlie: Right. The '*' representing any digit from '1' to '9' really opens up the possibilities. For starters, a single '*' can be decoded in 9 different ways, corresponding to the letters 'A' to 'I'.

Dana: I found the examples provided super helpful to understand the premise. Like, how "*" alone has 9 ways of decoding and "1*" can be decoded in 18 ways. It made me think deeply about how to systematically approach this.

Bob: Exactly, Dana. We should think about how to break down the decoding process, especially considering the wildcard. We need an efficient way to handle each character and possibly pairs of characters due to the two-digit letter mappings.

Alice: That's a good point, Bob. Considering pairs of characters is crucial, especially for handling cases like "1*" which can be mapped in multiple ways, not just as single digits but also as part of the two-digit numbers from '11' to '19'.

Charlie: And let's not forget the modulo operation. Since the answer can be really large, we're asked to return it modulo 10^9 + 7. It ensures the result stays within manageable bounds, a common practice for problems involving large numbers.

Dana: Right, we'll definitely need to apply dynamic programming for this. We must account for single digits, pairs, and the influence of the wildcard on these combinations without recalculating from scratch each time.

Alice: Yes, memorizing intermediate results to avoid recalculating them would optimize our approach. Perhaps we can use an array to keep track of the ways to decode sequences up to each point as we iterate through the message.

Bob: And handling edge cases like "0" and leading zeros is important too. "06" can't be mapped, as mentioned. Our logic has to correctly ignore invalid mappings.

Charlie: Implementing the logic to differentiate between valid and invalid pairs, especially with asterisks involved, seems like the biggest challenge. 

Dana: Definitely. So, if we're all in agreement, we need to dissect this problem by identifying valid single and double character mappings, incorporate dynamic programming to handle the large input sizes, and carefully manage modulo operations to keep our numbers within bounds.

Alice: Precisely. Let's also consider writing helper functions to clean up our main solution. Functions to calculate the number of ways to decode single characters and pairs could really help with readability and modularity.

Bob: Agreed. Well, I suppose our next step is diving into the implementation. Given what we've discussed, feels like we've got a strong grasp on the theoretical approach.

Charlie: Absolutely. Looking forward to seeing how our different implementations tackle this challenge. It's a great exercise in dynamic programming and handling edge cases!

Dana: Well then, happy coding everyone! Let's reconvene later with our solutions and insights. It's going to be exciting to see how we each approach this problem.
