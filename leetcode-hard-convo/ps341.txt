**Alice**: Hey guys, I've encountered a fascinating problem we might integrate into our internal transfer system for the next quarter. It deals with maximizing the number of employee transfer requests while ensuring each building maintains its current number of employees.

**Ben**: Sounds like a logistical challenge. How exactly are these transfers structured?

**Alice**: Well, we're given a scenario where we have 'n' buildings, each with a set of employees who wish to transfer to other buildings. The constraint is that the number of employees leaving a building must equal the number of employees entering it.

**Cara**: So, for instance, if we have three buildings and employees from building 0 want to move to building 1, we'd need an equal number of transfers into building 0 to keep the balance?

**Alice**: Exactly, Cara. The objective is to satisfy the maximum number of transfer requests without altering the net number of employees in each building.

**Ben**: How are these requests represented in the data?

**Alice**: The requests are given in an array where each entry is a pair indicating the employee's current building and their desired destination. For example, a request `[0, 1]` means an employee wants to move from building 0 to building 1.

**Cara**: I see. So, if an employee wishes to remain in their current building, would that be represented as `[0, 0]`?

**Alice**: Right on target, Cara. Even requests to stay in the same building are included and must be considered when determining the maximum number of achievable requests.

**Ben**: This sounds like a problem that requires some form of backtracking to iterate through all possible combinations of requests to find the optimal solution.

**Alice**: Precisely, we'd likely need to explore every subset of the request list and validate whether each subset satisfies the condition of net zero change for all buildings.

**Cara**: So, for each subset, we'd tally up the moves in and out of each building, checking if the net effect zeroes out?

**Alice**: Yes, and we'd keep track of the maximum number of requests we can fulfill where all buildings maintain equilibrium.

**Ben**: Interesting. I assume we also need to consider the computational complexity, given the potentially large number of request combinations with up to 16 requests.

**Alice**: Indeed. We'd have to be mindful of how we implement the solution to ensure it's optimized for speed, given the exponential nature of the problem.

**Cara**: It sounds like a solid plan. With the right approach, this could not only solve our problem but also provide a template for similar scenarios elsewhere.

**Ben**: Absolutely. It's definitely a challenge, but I think with some brainstorming, we can come up with a viable algorithm.

**Alice**: I'm glad you're both on board. Let's regroup after some individual research and lay down some potential strategies for tackling this.
