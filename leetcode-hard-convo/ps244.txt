**Alex**: Alright, team, we have this interesting problem where we've got a matrix M with certain dimensions. We’re aiming to figure out how to fill it with the maximum possible number of ones under some specific conditions. It’s quite the puzzle, isn’t it?

**Jordan**: Absolutely, it does sound like a fun challenge. Can you clarify the conditions a bit more for us?

**Alex**: Sure, Jordan. So, the matrix is defined by its width and height. But here’s the catch – we are restricted by sub-matrices of a given size that can contain a maximum number of ones. 

**Morgan**: Could you give us an example for better understanding?

**Alex**: Of course, Morgan. Let’s say we have a 3 by 3 matrix. If we consider any 2 by 2 sub-matrix inside it, it can have at most 1 one. It's an intriguing constraint that shapes how we can place those ones.

**Charlie**: I see, so it’s about strategically placing the ones to maximize their count given the constraint within any square sub-matrix. What would a general approach be to tackle this?

**Alex**: That’s the right train of thought, Charlie. We can start by analyzing patterns in the placement of ones in smaller matrices and see if those patterns can be applied or extended for larger matrices. The key could be in ensuring each sub-matrix adheres to the max ones rule.

**Jordan**: So, in terms of steps, we need to first understand how to optimally fill a sub-matrix of sideLength by sideLength with maxOnes ones. That sounds like a foundational step before scaling up.

**Morgan**: Right, and according to the constraints given, our approach needs to be scalable since the matrix dimensions can go up to 100 by 100. It means our strategy must be efficient for larger matrices too.

**Charlie**: Efficiency definitely is key. I'm thinking, is there a mathematical pattern or formula that could simplify the placement of ones, especially for larger matrices?

**Alex**: Great point, Charlie. Identifying a pattern or a formula can significantly simplify our approach. It would involve understanding how the ones can be distributed in smaller matrices and extrapolating from there.

**Jordan**: It’s like a puzzle within a puzzle. And once we have a viable strategy, I assume we iterate through the entire matrix applying our optimum sub-matrix pattern while respecting the given dimensions and constraints.

**Morgan**: Also, considering edge cases, like when the sub-matrix size equals the matrix size, could simplify our problem or offer insights into efficient placement.

**Alex**: Exactly, everyone. Tackling this problem methodically, starting from the sub-matrix level and then scaling up while considering efficiency, patterns, and edge cases will be our roadmap. Let’s brainstorm ideas, come up with a plan and algorithm, and then we can simulate it and test it against different scenarios.

**Charlie**: Sounds like a plan. Let’s get those whiteboards ready and start breaking down the problem. This is going to be an interesting session.

**Alex**: Agreed, let’s dive in and unleash our creativity. Solving this will not only be fulfilling but will also enhance our problem-solving skills. Let’s do this!
