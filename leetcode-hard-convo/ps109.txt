**Alice:** Hey folks, gather around, we need to brainstorm a way to compute the number of possible attendance records that make a student eligible for an award given the length `n`.

**Ben:** Right, the key points are that a student can't be absent more than once and can't be late 3 days in a row. So, we're essentially dealing with permutations of the letters 'A', 'L', and 'P', with those constraints.

**Charlie:** For a small `n`, it seems manageable to list out all permutations and filter based on our criteria, but that approach won't scale. For something like `n = 10101`, we need a more efficient way to calculate it.

**Alice:** Exactly, brute force is out of the question for large `n`. We need to think about patterns or properties of these sequences that we can exploit. Maybe there's a way to build valid sequences of length `n` from those of smaller lengths?

**Ben:** That's a good point, Alice. We can think of this problem recursively or iteratively by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. But we also need to keep in mind the modulo `109 + 7` part.

**Charlie:** About the 'A' constraint, since there can be at most one 'A' in a valid sequence, we could essentially split the problem into two cases: sequences with no 'A' and sequences with exactly one 'A'.

**Alice:** Right, for the sequences without any 'A', we only have to worry about the 'L' constraint. As for sequences with an 'A', we can place the 'A' in any position and then calculate valid sequences for the parts before and after the 'A'.

**Ben:** Handling the 'L' constraint sounds tricky, especially for sequences without an 'A'. We can't have three 'L's in a row. Maybe we can think about the ending of sequences? Like, how many sequences of length `n` end with 0, 1, or 2 'L's?

**Charlie:** That's a clever angle, Ben. If we track sequences based on how they end, we might be able to recursively or iteratively build up the count for sequences of length `n` from those of lengths `n-1`, `n-2`, and so on.

**Alice:** And don't forget, any sequence of length `n` can be thought of as an extension of a sequence of length `n-1` by adding a 'P', a 'PL', or a 'PLL' at the end, keeping in mind the 'A' placement for other scenarios.

**Ben:** Right. For the implementation part, it sounds like dynamic programming could be a solid approach, using memoization to store counts of sequences up to a certain length that satisfy our criteria.

**Charlie:** Definitely. And regarding modulo `109 + 7`, we should apply it at every step of our computation to ensure we don't run into issues with integer overflow.

**Alice:** Great discussion, team. I think we have a solid groundwork for the algorithm. Let's start experimenting with some pseudo-code and see if our idea holds up. Remember, we're optimizing for both correctness and efficiency here.
