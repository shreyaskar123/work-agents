**Alex:** Hey, I came across a fascinating problem today. Do you have a minute to discuss it?

**Jordan:** Sure, what's it about?

**Alex:** It's about finding if a path crosses itself. You're given an array of integers representing distances. You start moving north, then turn west, then south, then east, and so on, in a counter-clockwise direction. The question is, how do you figure out if your path crosses itself at any point?

**Jordan:** Oh, that sounds quite interesting. Are there any constraints or specifics I need to be aware of?

**Alex:** Yes, the length of the distance array can be up to 500, and each distance value is between 1 to 500. It’s somewhat of a spatial puzzle.

**Jordan:** Got it. So, would tracking the coordinates after each move help in identifying a cross?

**Alex:** That’s a direction to think about, but remember, efficiency is key here. We don’t want to be storing lots of data unnecessarily.

**Jordan:** Right. So then rather than keeping track of all positions, maybe we should focus on the current and previous distances to anticipate a cross. Each fourth step should be compared to the previous ones in a certain pattern, I suppose.

**Alex:** Exactly. Consider how each new move could potentially intersect with parts of the path. For example, moving north, then west, then south - the south move needs to be evaluated against the north move for any potential intersections.

**Jordan:** Makes sense. And when moving east, it's crucial to compare it with the first segment and check for overlaps, ensuring not to just check the immediate previous segment but perhaps ones before that.

**Alex:** Right. Now the challenge is to do all these checks efficiently. Any thoughts?

**Jordan:** I'm thinking about how the directions change and how that pattern impacts the potential for crossings. Maybe, identifying specific conditions under which crossings happen could streamline the process.

**Alex:** True. Also, considering it's a counter-clockwise movement, each step has a predictable effect on the possibility of crossing previous paths. This predictability should help in formulating a logic to check for crosses without needing to track every move.

**Jordan:** So, focusing on the relation between two non-consecutive moves based on their directions and distances might just be the key. Would implementing checks based on these relations at each step make it efficient?

**Alex:** Precisely. And managing to keep the space complexity minimal while doing these checks in a single pass through the distance array would be ideal. Any ideas for managing that?

**Jordan:** That does complicate things a bit. But, considering the problem's repetitive nature, there might be a way to deduce the position or potential crossing without explicitly tracking each coordinate. It's like a mathematical pattern emerging from the chaos.

**Alex:** Yes, and that's where the beauty of the solution lies. It’s almost like a dance of numbers, where each step is a clue to the next. You’ve got a good grasp of the direction to head towards for solving this.

**Jordan:** Definitely an intriguing problem. I'll need to think more about the specifics of the algorithm, but this conversation has laid a great foundation. Thanks for bringing it up.

**Alex:** Anytime, I knew it would catch your interest. Let’s reconvene once you’ve had some time to mull over it. Maybe, a fresh perspective will bring us closer to the solution.

**Jordan:** Agreed, I’m looking forward to cracking it. Let’s touch base again soon.
