**Alice:** Good morning everyone. Today, we're going to tackle a problem that revolves around finding the number of non-empty submatrices in a given matrix that sum up to a particular target. It's a fascinating problem that combines elements of dynamic programming with some clever iteration strategies. 

**Bob:** Sounds interesting, Alice. Can you elaborate on what exactly a submatrix is in this context?

**Alice:** Certainly, Bob. A submatrix, in simple terms, is a smaller matrix that's part of a larger matrix. The definition we're working with specifies a submatrix by its top-left and bottom-right coordinates. So, a submatrix defined by coordinates `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` includes all the elements `matrix[x][y]` where `x1 <= x <= x2` and `y1 <= y <= y2`. 

**Charlie:** That makes sense. I imagine the challenge here is to efficiently go through all possible submatrices and check if their sum equals the target. Is there a particular reason why we're focusing on non-empty submatrices?

**Alice:** Good question, Charlie. The emphasis on non-empty submatrices is just to refine the problem's scope. An empty submatrix, which doesn't contain any elements, is conceptually simpler and doesn't really contribute to the complexity of this challenge. Our goal is to tackle the more interesting cases where we have actual numbers to work with.

**Diana:** I'm curious about the approach. Given that the matrix can be quite large, how do we efficiently find these submatrices without brute-forcing every possible combination?

**Alice:** That's the crux of the problem, Diana. Brute force is certainly an option, but it's not feasible for larger matrices due to its unfavorable time complexity. An efficient approach involves using dynamic programming to keep track of sums in a clever way, which can dramatically reduce the time complexity. One strategy could be to precompute the sums of certain areas so that we can quickly calculate the sum of any submatrix using those precomputed values.

**Bob:** Precomputing sums sounds like a solid strategy. It's similar to calculating running sums but in two dimensions, right?

**Alice:** Precisely, Bob. This precomputation allows us to apply a form of inclusion-exclusion principle where we can obtain the sum of any submatrix in constant time, given we have computed the necessary preliminary data.

**Charlie:** I understand the precomputation part, but how do we apply this to find submatrices that match our target sum?

**Alice:** That’s where the algorithm gets interesting. Once we have our precomputed sums, we iterate through all possible top-left points of our submatrices. For each top-left point, we explore extending the submatrix to the right and downward, checking if the resulting submatrix matches our target sum.

**Diana:** I see. So, it’s about strategically iterating and checking our sums against the target. Do we need to watch out for any specific edge cases or constraints given the problem's parameters?

**Alice:** Definitely, Diana. Considering the problem constraints, it's essential to ensure our solution remains efficient across a variety of matrix sizes. Edge cases might include extremely large matrices, negative numbers, or large target sums, which could affect the implementation of our algorithm. Keeping an eye on how we handle these cases is crucial for coming up with a robust solution.

**Bob:** This has been an enlightening discussion. I feel we have a good starting point to tackle this problem head-on. Let's start implementing and see how our strategy holds up against the test cases.

**Alice:** Agreed, let’s jump into it. As always, let's keep collaboration and communication open as we work through this challenge. Happy coding, everyone!
