**Alex**: Hey, Jamie. I've been grappling with this programming challenge involving arrays and queries. I read about it earlier today, and I thought maybe you could help me untangle it a bit?

**Jamie**: Sure, Alex. I'm intrigued. Could you lay out the specifics?

**Alex**: Absolutely. It goes like this: we're given a zero-indexed integer array called `nums`. This array consists of 'n' non-negative integers. Alongside, there's another array titled `queries`. Each element in `queries` is a pair `[xi, yi]`.

**Jamie**: Okay, so what's the task at hand with these arrays?

**Alex**: The challenge is to answer each query according to a set criterion. For the 'i-th' query, we need to find the sum of all `nums[j]` where `xi <= j < n` and the difference `(j - xi)` is divisible by `yi`.

**Jamie**: Interesting. Can you give me an example to ensure I'm following?

**Alex**: Sure. Let's say `nums` is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], and `queries` are [[0,3],[5,1],[4,2]]. The output for these inputs should be [9,18,10], based on the conditions provided.

**Jamie**: Got it. The aim is to process each query, calculate the specified sums, and return them as an array of answers. 

**Alex**: Precisely. And each answer has to be modulo `109 + 7`. That's an essential part of the problem.

**Jamie**: Alright, let's break this down. For handling the conditions set for the j indices, would it be efficient to iterate over each query and then within that loop, iterate over the range of indices from `xi` to `n-1` looking for those which satisfy `(j - xi) mod yi == 0`?

**Alex**: That sounds like a straightforward approach, but I'm thinking about the performance on large data sets.

**Jamie**: True, brute-force could get expensive with big arrays. We might have to think of a way to reduce the number of iterations or perhaps pre-compute some data to speed things up.

**Alex**: Exactly. Pre-computation could be key, especially if there's a pattern or a mathematical property we can exploit to skip directly to relevant indices instead of checking each one.

**Jamie**: Hmm, let's think about how the division rule impacts our indices selection. Maybe there's a formula we can derive to jump directly to the next valid index in the nums array.

**Alex**: That would be ideal. If we could somehow find the next valid index without iterating through every single one, we'd drastically reduce the complexity.

**Jamie**: Let's also not forget the modulo operation. It must be applied carefully to avoid any overflow issues. Especially since the problem constraints allow for quite large numbers.

**Alex**: Right. The modulo operation should be applied to the sum before storing the answer for each query to respect those constraints.

**Jamie**: Okay, I think we have a pretty good starting point. Next steps could involve sketching out some pseudo-code to model our thought process, focusing on efficiently finding those indices and managing the modulo operation correctly.

**Alex**: Agreed. I appreciate your insights, Jamie. This gives me a much clearer direction on how to tackle the problem. Let's regroup after drafting some initial code?

**Jamie**: Sounds like a plan, Alex. Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
