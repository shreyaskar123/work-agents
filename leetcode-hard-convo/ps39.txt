**Jamal**: So, we’re looking at tackling this challenge where we need to find the minimum element in a sorted but rotated array, right? And this time it could contain duplicates.

**Alex**: Exactly, and that’s where the twist comes in. With duplicates, the usual binary search approach gets a bit trickier.

**Casey**: Right, because when you choose the middle element in a binary search, duplicates can mislead the direction in which you search for the minimum.

**Jamal**: Let’s use an example here. Consider the array `[2,2,2,0,1]`. If we pick the middle element, it's `2`, but both sides of the array have `2` as well, making it challenging to decide which way to go.

**Alex**: Precisely. So the strategy needs to account for the possibility that the left, middle, and right elements might be the same. We should think about a way to handle this scenario.

**Casey**: I think we can still utilize binary search but with some modifications. We have to add a check where if we encounter duplicates, we can't immediately decide which half of the array holds the minimum.

**Jamal**: Yeah, and in that case, maybe we can reduce our search space by one, essentially skipping the duplicates, until we find a clear indication of where the minimum is.

**Alex**: That’s a solid approach. But always keeping in mind binary search's essence, which is reducing the problem size significantly with each step.

**Casey**: Exactly. So, our modified binary search would have to carefully pick its direction not just based on the middle element but also how it compares to the ends of the current search interval.

**Jamal**: So, let's think about a decision tree. If we land in a situation where `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[high]`, we can conclude...

**Alex**: That the minimum must be in the right half because the elements are increasing from left to mid but then drop.

**Casey**: And conversely, if `nums[mid]` is less than `nums[high]`, our search narrows down to the left half. But what about the duplicates?

**Jamal**: Right, in the case of duplicates, like if `nums[mid]` equals `nums[high]`, we could maybe increment `high` by one to narrow the search space, as we can't determine the direction.

**Alex**: It’s a more cautious approach, essentially inching our way through the duplicates until the binary search's direction becomes clear.

**Casey**: It's important to remember, though, that while this handles duplicates, it could slightly degrade performance.

**Jamal**: So the twist with duplicates doesn't change the algorithm's nature but requires an additional layer of subtlety to handle the uncertainty they introduce.

**Alex**: Exactly, maintaining the essence of binary search with a sprinkle of careful handling of edge cases.

**Casey**: With this in mind, implementing our solution should be straightforward, keeping an eye on the potential impact of duplicates on our binary search algorithm.

**Jamal**: Sounds like a plan. Let’s draft up some pseudo-code and start testing it with different scenarios to ensure our solution handles both unique and duplicate elements gracefully.
