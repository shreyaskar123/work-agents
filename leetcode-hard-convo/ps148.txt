**Alex**: So we’re tasked with evaluating Lisp-like expressions, right?

**Jordan**: Exactly. The expressions can be integers, let-expressions, add-expressions, mult-expressions, or variables.

**Sam**: Alright, let’s break it down then. For integers, it’s straightforward; we just return the integer itself.

**Alex**: And for variables, we’d need to look up their values. There’s a scope rule mentioned, so variables can shadow outer variables. We’ll need to manage some sort of environment to keep track of variable assignments.

**Jordan**: The let-expression seems a bit more complex. We have pairs of variables and expressions, ending with a final expression to evaluate after all assignments.

**Sam**: That’s true. We could recursively evaluate expressions and update our environment with the new variable bindings before evaluating the final expression.

**Alex**: What about add and mult-expressions?

**Jordan**: Those should be simpler, just recursively evaluate the two expressions and then either add or multiply their results.

**Sam**: We need to carefully manage scope, especially when evaluating nested expressions. A stack could help simulate the changing environment as we go deeper into the expressions.

**Alex**: Makes sense. For each new expression, especially in a let-expression, we push a new environment onto the stack, evaluate, and then pop it off once done.

**Jordan**: And with the scope rules, if a variable is not found in the innermost scope, we check the outer ones, in order.

**Sam**: Sounds like a plan. Recursive evaluation with careful management of environments using a stack should do the trick.

**Alex**: Do you think we'd encounter any corner cases with this approach?

**Jordan**: Well, our base cases are clear: integers return themselves, and variables are looked up in the environment. As long as we manage the environments correctly for each expression type, we should be good.

**Sam**: What about error handling? The prompt promises legal expressions, but should we consider any form of validation?

**Alex**: Given the prompt ensures the expressions are legal and well-formed, I'd focus on the logic first. But yeah, in a real-world scenario, we definitely need to consider validation and error handling. 

**Jordan**: And performance? With a maximum expression length of 2000, recursion depth and environmental stack management efficiency could be concerns.

**Sam**: True. Fortunately, Lisp-like expressions with their clear and predictable structure lend themselves well to recursive algorithms. Optimizing recursion and efficient environment management will be key.

**Alex**: Alright, I think we have a good starting point. Let's start implementing and see how it goes. Can always adjust as we test our solution with different expressions.

**Jordan**: Sounds like a plan. Let’s get to work.
