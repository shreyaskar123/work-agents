**Riley**: Hey, Morgan, I'm stumped on a problem I came across. It's about finding the k-th ancestor of a node in a tree, and I figured you might have some insights on it. 

**Morgan**: Sure, Riley. Could you give me more details about the problem? How is the tree represented?

**Riley**: The tree is represented as an array where each element denotes the parent of the node at that index. The root node is node 0 and has no parent, therefore, marked with -1. 

**Morgan**: Got it. And you need to find the k-th ancestor of a given node, right? What's the approach you're considering?

**Riley**: Yes, exactly. I'm not entirely sure where to start. I thought of tracing the path back to the root from the given node and counting the steps, but I'm concerned about the efficiency with multiple queries.

**Morgan**: That makes sense. Considering there could be up to 50,000 queries, it makes sense to look for a more efficient approach. Have you thought about pre-processing the data to make the queries faster?

**Riley**: Pre-processing? How would that work for this problem?

**Morgan**: You might want to consider using dynamic programming to pre-calculate the ancestors at different levels for each node. This way, when you receive a query, you can retrieve the k-th ancestor in a much more efficient manner.

**Riley**: Hmm... I'm not entirely clear on how to set that up. Could you give me more detail?

**Morgan**: Well, without diving into code, think about creating a 2D array where one dimension represents the nodes and the other represents the powers of two up to k. Each element in the array could store the 2^i-th ancestor of a node. 

**Riley**: So, it's like pre-computing the path but in jumps of powers of two?

**Morgan**: Exactly! This method takes advantage of the fact that any number k can be represented as a sum of powers of two. So to find the k-th ancestor, you'd just need to move through the ancestors at those power intervals.

**Riley**: That's pretty smart. But how intensive is the pre-processing? Won't it be heavy on resources?

**Morgan**: It's more upfront work, yes. You will need to calculate and store ancestors for power of twos, but it significantly reduces the time complexity for each query. The space complexity does increase, though, given the need for a 2D array.

**Riley**: I see... and during a query, you just break down k into powers of two and follow the pre-computed paths?

**Morgan**: Precisely. You iterate over the bits of k, and for each bit that is set, you move the corresponding power of two steps up the ancestor tree using the pre-computed values.

**Riley**: That's clever. I was focusing on linear traversal, but this jumps approach is much more scalable. It's like a bit manipulation combined with dynamic programming.

**Morgan**: Exactly right! It's a perfect example of blending concepts for an efficient solution. Do you think you have a good starting point now?

**Riley**: Definitely. Thanks, Morgan! I'm going to sketch this out and start coding it. I'll reach out if I hit a snag.

**Morgan**: Anytime, Riley. Happy to help. Good luck with your implementation!
