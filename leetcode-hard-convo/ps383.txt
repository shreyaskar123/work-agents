**Mia:** Hey everyone, thanks for joining today's meeting. Let’s jump right in. We’ve got to tackle a pretty interesting problem related to undirected graphs. 

**Alex:** Sounds good, Mia. What’s the task at hand?

**Mia:** Well, we’re given an undirected graph represented by an integer `n`, which stands for the number of nodes, and an array of edges. Each element in this array consists of two integers, indicating there’s an edge between those nodes.

**Jordan:** Oh, and is there anything special about these edges?

**Mia:** Good question, the edges are undirected, and surprisingly, there can be repeated edges between the same nodes.

**Alex:** And what exactly are we supposed to find with this graph?

**Mia:** We’re given another array called `queries`. For each query, we need to find the number of pairs of nodes `(a, b)`, where `a < b`, and the number of edges incident to `a` or `b` is strictly greater than the value of the query.

**Jordan:** That sounds a bit complex. Could you delve into how we approach figuring out the `cnt` for each pair?

**Mia:** Sure, think about a node in the graph. The `cnt` for a node would essentially be the count of edges that are incident to it. Since we're looking for pairs where the combined edge count of both is considered, you’d sum up the counts for both nodes but ensure you don't double count any shared edges if they're directly connected.

**Alex:** Oh, so calculating the edge counts for each node seems like a crucial step. Is there a specific data structure we might use for that to make our lives easier?

**Mia:** Exactly, Alex. Using a hash map or a similar structure could help us keep track of the edge counts for each node efficiently. We'd iterate through the edges array to populate this.

**Jordan:** Makes sense. But dealing with queries feels a bit more complicated. Any hints on how we efficiently answer those without recalculating every single time?

**Mia:** A key insight is preprocessing. If we can somehow preprocess the graph to understand the distribution of these edge counts, we could potentially answer queries faster. Think in terms of sorting or even some form of cumulative frequency technique.

**Alex:** Ah, I see where this is heading. Maybe sort the nodes based on their edge count and then use that sorted list to quickly answer queries based on the thresholds they provide.

**Jordan:** And presumably, we’d have to tackle those repeated edges in a way that they don’t skew our counts.

**Mia:** Precisely. When processing the edges, be mindful of repeated edges and consider how they impact your counts and how you might adjust for them in your final calculation.

**Alex:** This definitely sets us on the right path. For tackling each query, I’m assuming binary search could come in handy, given the sorted nature of our data.

**Mia:** Spot on, Alex. Utilizing binary search could drastically reduce the complexity of answering queries. 

**Jordan:** I think this gives us a clear strategy to approach this task. We start by calculating edge counts, sort our nodes accordingly, then answer the queries efficiently using our preprocessed data.

**Mia:** Exactly, team. And always remember, the devil is in the details, so watch out for those edge cases, especially the repeated edges. Let’s start implementing this and regroup later to discuss our progress.

**Alex:** Sounds like a plan. Let’s get to it!
