**Jamie**: Hey everyone, thanks for coming together today. We've got an interesting challenge to tackle involving finding valid words based on specific puzzles.

**Alex**: Sounds intriguing! Could you elaborate a bit more on what defines a 'valid word' in this context?

**Jamie**: Of course. A word is considered valid if it meets two criteria. First, it must contain the first letter of the given puzzle. Second, every letter in the word must be found in the puzzle.

**Morgan**: So, if the puzzle was "abcdefg", a word like "faced" would be valid because it contains "a" and every letter in "faced" is in the puzzle, right?

**Jamie**: Exactly, Morgan! On the flip side, "beefed" would be invalid since it doesn't include "a", and "based" is also out because it includes "s", which isn't in the puzzle.

**Alex**: Got it. So, how are we planning to solve this? It sounds like iterating over each word for every puzzle could get pretty intensive.

**Jamie**: That's a good point. The brute force approach of checking each word against each puzzle isn't efficient, especially with our constraints. We'd likely hit performance issues given the number of words and puzzles.

**Taylor**: Couldn't we optimize this by pre-processing the words in some way? Maybe by indexing them according to the letters they contain?

**Jamie**: That's a promising avenue, Taylor. Pre-processing the words to avoid reevaluating them for each puzzle could save us a lot of redundant checks.

**Morgan**: What about puzzles? Since each puzzle is only seven letters and doesn't contain repeats, perhaps we could leverage that somehow?

**Jamie**: Right, we could potentially use the unique characteristics of puzzles to our advantage. Remember, the first letter is crucial for a word to be considered valid.

**Alex**: This preprocessing idea... Are we thinking about using bitmasking or something similar to represent the letters in words and puzzles?

**Jamie**: Exactly, Alex. Bitmasking could allow us to efficiently compare letters in words to those in puzzles. It's a way to compactly represent and manipulate sets of letters.

**Taylor**: So we'd convert each word and puzzle into a bitmask representation and then? How do we proceed to count valid words for each puzzle?

**Jamie**: Without going into code specifics, we'd compare the bitmask of each word with the bitmask of the puzzle, ensuring the first letter condition is also met. The details would involve bit operations to check for the presence of necessary letters.

**Morgan**: Ah, checking if the word's bitmask is a subset of the puzzle's bitmask, but also ensuring the first letter of the puzzle is included in the word. 

**Alex**: This sounds like a solid plan! Preprocessing words into a bitmask format, then efficiently comparing these against each puzzle's bitmask representation could definitely work.

**Jamie**: Precisely. I'll start outlining a more detailed approach and share it with the group. Let's reconvene tomorrow to discuss the implementation specifics and divide up the work.

**Taylor**: Sounds good. Looking forward to tackling this together!

**Jamie**: Great, thanks everyone for the input. Let's make this happen!
