**Alice**: Hey folks, I've been thinking about that tricky pathfinding problem we discussed last week for the m*n grid. How would you go about it if we can remove up to k obstacles?

**Bob**: That's an interesting one. First thing that comes to mind is using a graph traversal algorithm. But given the possibility to remove obstacles, it's not straightforward.

**Charlie**: True, standard BFS wouldn't work out of the box since we need to account for the obstacles. But what if we enhanced BFS to track the number of obstacles we've removed on each path?

**Alice**: That sounds promising. So you're suggesting we keep track of the position, the number of steps, and how many obstacles we've encountered?

**Bob**: Exactly, and we could use a queue to implement that. But there's a catch with the queue - we'd need to also store how many obstacles we've removed in the path so far.

**Charlie**: Right. So, essentially, each element in the queue would be a tuple or a structure that contains the current cell's coordinates, the number of steps taken to reach there, and the count of obstacles removed.

**Alice**: I'm following. And for each cell we visit, we could try moving in all four directions, as long as we don't go out of the grid or exceed the maximum number of obstacles we're allowed to remove.

**Bob**: Precisely, and it's crucial to avoid revisiting the same cell with the same or higher number of obstacles removed. We could use a 3D array for marking visited states to handle that aspect.

**Charlie**: Makes sense. That way, the third dimension could represent the number of obstacles removed, and we effectively track states like `(x, y, k)` to prevent unnecessary revisits.

**Alice**: I see. But then, how do we know when to stop? What's our end condition?

**Bob**: If we reach the lower right corner of the grid, that would be our goal. At that point, we can return the number of steps from the tuple.

**Charlie**: And if we exhaust the queue without reaching the end, that means there's no possible path given the constraints, and we return -1.

**Alice**: Got it. Seems like a solid plan. The only worrying part might be the complexity, given the grid size and the k constraint. But it's worth a try. Do we need a special case for when `k` is larger than the number of obstacles in our path?

**Bob**: Ideally, our algorithm should naturally handle that by allowing us to bypass all obstacles without exceeding `k`. So in principle, no special handling needed beyond what we've laid out.

**Charlie**: Agreed. It's all about effectively traversing and marking visited states while respecting the limits. Shall we prototype this approach and run some test cases?

**Alice**: Sure, let's do it. Thanks for hashing this out, guys. I think we're on the right path now.
