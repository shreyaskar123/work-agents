**Alex**: So, we're looking at solving an interesting problem today. It's about finding the number of ways to fill an array of a given size such that the product of the integers equals a specific target. We need to approach this systematically since we're dealing with potentially large numbers and permutations.

**Jordan**: Right, the modulo `109 + 7` part implies we're expecting really large numbers. It's a common prime to use for mod operations to avoid overflow. The first thing that comes to mind is we might need to look into prime factorization of the target, `ki`. Because the product needing to equal `ki` essentially boils down to distributing its prime factors.

**Sam**: That's a solid starting point. Factorizing `ki` would give us the base components we need to work with. Considering the example of `ki = 6`, its factors are 2 and 3. The question then becomes, how do we distribute these factors into an array of `ni` elements?

**Alex**: Exactly, and the number of ways we can distribute these factors can vary greatly depending on how many of them there are and how they can be combined. We should also consider the case where the target, `ki`, is 1, as it simplifies to just filling the array with 1s.

**Jordan**: When it comes to implementation, we need a fast way to factorize numbers and a dynamic approach to distribute these factors. A naive method could be very slow, so maybe we should look into dynamic programming or some kind of memoization to avoid recalculating scenarios.

**Sam**: Discussing dynamic programming, we'll need to think about our states and decisions. The state could be defined by how many items we've filled in the array and the current product of these items. Our decisions would then revolve around which factor to place next and in which position.

**Alex**: Don't forget the modulo operation. Every time we calculate a possible way or a sum of ways, we need to apply the modulo to keep the numbers manageable and within the required bounds.

**Jordan**: And regarding the actual code structure, I assume we'll use a recursive function for simplicity, but with added memoization to store already computed results. This avoids exponential runtime by not recalculating the same scenarios.

**Sam**: Thereâ€™s also the aspect of handling the division of the product to allocate factors properly across the array. Since it's not mentioned that we're restricted to integers, we have to consider how to manage fractional scenarios or avoid them altogether by smart distribution.

**Alex**: Before we start coding, let's recap our approach. Prime factorize `ki`, use dynamic programming with memoization to distribute factors into the array of size `ni`, remember to apply modulo `109 + 7` to our results, and watch out for edge cases like `ki = 1`.

**Jordan**: Sounds like a plan. Let's also consider writing some test cases covering these edge scenarios to ensure our solution is robust, including the large numbers and the given examples.

**Sam**: Once we have a draft solution, we should analyze its time and space complexity to ensure it meets the problem's constraints. We can then optimize further if necessary.

**Alex**: All right, let's start implementing. We'll tackle this step by step, beginning with the factorization and gradually building up our dynamic programming solution.
