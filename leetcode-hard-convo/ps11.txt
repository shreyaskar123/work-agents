**Alex:** Hey everyone, thanks for joining today's brainstorming session. We're here to tackle a coding challenge that focuses on reversing nodes of a linked list in groups of 'k'. The twist is trying to keep it as space efficient as possible.

**Jordan:** Right, reversing the nodes without messing with the values themselves. This is a pretty common problem but optimizing it for space adds a nice challenge. Just to clarify, we're working with singly linked lists, correct?

**Alex:** Exactly, a singly linked list. Let's first think about how we'd approach this problem without the space constraint. How would we reverse sections of the list?

**Charlie:** Well, traditionally you'd iterate through the list, and for each block of 'k' elements, you'd perform a local reverse. That means detaching the segment, reversing it, then reattaching it to the main list.

**Sam:** That's right, Charlie. The detachment and reattachment need careful pointer manipulation. It's like having a sublist, reversing it, and then integrating it back.

**Jordan:** So, considering the follow-up question, we should aim for `O(1)` extra space, which means we can't really afford to create a separate sublist or use recursion since that would use stack space.

**Alex:** Good point. Let's focus on optimizing that. How do we maintain the efficiency while ensuring we don't use extra space unnecessarily?

**Charlie:** It's all about the pointers. We'll need to use multiple pointers to track our current position in the list, the start of the section we're reversing, and the end of that section.

**Sam:** Also, don't forget the connections between different groups. After reversing a block, we need to make sure its new tail (previously the head) is connected to the next part of the list, which might also need reversing.

**Jordan:** Sounds like we'd loop through the list, identify blocks of 'k' nodes, reverse those blocks using pointer manipulation, and ensure all pointers are correctly assigned after each reversal. Correct?

**Alex:** Precisely. For a list of size 'n' and segments of size 'k', we'd essentially perform 'n/k' reversals. Each reversal is linear in the size of the segment but constant in the overall list size.

**Charlie:** And for the parts of the list where there aren't enough nodes left to form a group of 'k', we leave them as is, right?

**Sam:** Yeah, the problem statement mentioned that if the number of nodes is not a multiple of 'k', the left-out nodes should remain unchanged.

**Jordan:** I think we've got a solid understanding. So, our goal is to manage this with just a few pointers, ensuring we don't use any extra space beyond those few variables.

**Alex:** Exactly. It's a matter of carefully walking through the list, reversing small parts at a time, and connecting them properly. Thanks, everyone, for contributing. Let's start drafting some pseudo-code based on this discussion and then dive into coding.

**Charlie:** Sounds good. This was a productive meeting on approaching the problem methodically and efficiently. 

**Sam:** Agreed. Looking forward to seeing this solution come to life!
