**Alex**: Hey, have you all tackled a problem where you have to figure out if an equation, formed by words, actually sums up correctly but with a twist?

**Jordan**: Interesting! What kind of twist?

**Alex**: So, each character in the words represents a unique digit from 0 to 9. Different characters must map to different digits, and there’s no leading zeros in any of the number representations.

**Casey**: Sounds like a cryptarithmetic puzzle. How do you even start with something like that?

**Alex**: That's right, Casey. At first glance, it seems straightforward but requires a bit of a systematic approach. You’d have to consider each word on the left side of the equation and decode them along with the result on the right to see if they sum up correctly.

**Jordan**: Oh, I see. So, for example, if the input words were ["SEND", "MORE"] and the result was "MONEY", we mapping each letter to a digit to see if it adds up?

**Alex**: Exactly, Jordan. And in this case, it’s a valid equation if you find the right mapping between letters and digits.

**Casey**: This sounds like it might involve a bit of permutation to try out different mappings.

**Alex**: You’re on the right track. You can’t brute force all possibilities though, especially since the number of different characters used in any given expression is limited. 

**Jordan**: Makes sense. This means we have to keep a close watch on the unique characters and possibly the length of the result versus the combined lengths of the words on the left.

**Casey**: Right. The position of each letter within the word likely plays a crucial role in its value. Like, a letter in the hundred's place contributes more than in the ten's place.

**Alex**: Spot on, Casey! Each letter’s position influences its potential value, making some letters inherently more valuable based on their position in the word or the result.

**Jordan**: Seems like a puzzle where mapping letters to the highest possible values without conflicts or breaking the rules is key. 

**Alex**: Precisely. And remember, the sum of the numbers represented by words on the left side must exactly equal the number represented by the result on the right side.

**Casey**: I'm guessing identifying the first letter of each word and the result would be vital too, considering the constraint against leading zeros.

**Alex**: Indeed. That's an important observation. The strategy to solve this must include that consideration to ensure validity of the proposed solution.

**Jordan**: Wow, that’s a deeply fascinating problem. It feels like a mix of logical deduction and systematic trial and error to find a compatible mapping.

**Alex**: Couldn’t have described it better myself. It’s about finding that perfect blend of logic and systematic exploration to verify the solvability of the equation.
