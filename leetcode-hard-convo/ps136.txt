**Alex**: Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining today's brainstorming session. We've got an interesting problem to solve where we need to analyze a directed graph that was initially a rooted tree but then had one additional directed edge added. Our goal is to figure out which edge to remove to revert it back to a rooted tree. Any initial thoughts?

**Jordan**: Right off the bat, I think understanding the properties of a rooted tree is crucial. Remember, in a valid rooted tree, except for the root node, every other node has exactly one parent, and there's a single path from the root to any node.

**Sam**: That's a good point, Jordan. With the addition of one extra edge, it seems to me this graph could either have a loop or a node with two parents. Identifying which situation we're dealing with should be our first step.

**Alex**: Agreed. Let's consider how we might detect a node with two parents.

**Jordan**: If we iterate through the edges, we can track the parent of each node. If at any point we notice a node being assigned a second parent, that's a red flag. We'd know there's an edge involved that could potentially be removed to fix the tree.

**Sam**: But what if the issue isn't a node with two parents, but a loop instead? How do we approach that?

**Jordan**: For detecting a loop, we'd need some way to track if we can reach a node from itself by following the directed edges, right? That sounds like a depth-first search (DFS) scenario to me.

**Alex**: Makes sense. The tricky part, though, is deciding which edge to remove, especially since the problem statement indicates that if there are multiple valid edges, we return the one that occurs last in the given 2D array.

**Sam**: The hint there might be in how we record our findings. If a node has two potential parents, keeping track of those edges and their occurrence in the input list could help us decide which one to remove, assuming no loop is involved.

**Jordan**: True. And if there is a loop, the last edge we encounter in our search that completes the loop would be our target for removal. We'd need to carefully track our path as we conduct the DFS.

**Alex**: So, it sounds like we have a two-step strategy developing here. First, identify if we have a node with two parents or a loop. Then, based on that, figure out which edge is causing the problem, keeping in mind we might have to prioritize removing an edge that creates a loop over one that creates a redundancy.

**Sam**: Exactly. And throughout this process, keeping track of the edges' indices or order will be essential. That way, if we find multiple candidates, we know to choose the one that appears last.

**Jordan**: It's also worth noting that in our code, we should carefully handle the case where both a loop and a node with two parents are present. It might complicate the logic, but it's definitely something to be aware of.

**Alex**: Great points all around. Let's start outlining our approach, considering these insights. We can iterate through the process, first identifying potential edges to remove and then refining our choice based on the edge's position in the input array and the specific issue it causes in the graph.

**Sam**: Sounds like a plan. This is going to require some careful coding to handle all the nuances, but I think we've got a solid understanding of how to proceed.

**Jordan**: Absolutely. Let's get to it and regroup with our findings and code snippets to make sure we're on track.

**Alex**: Thanks, team. Looking forward to seeing how we can solve this one. Let's tackle it!
