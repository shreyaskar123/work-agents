**Simon**: Hey folks, glad we could meet. I have this programming challenge I was hoping to brainstorm on. It's about calculating possible routes between two cities with a given amount of fuel.

**Mia**: Oh, that sounds like an interesting problem. We're looking at distinct city locations with starting and ending points and a fuel limit, right?

**Alex**: Exactly. And each move uses fuel based on the distance between cities. We need to find all possible routes from start to finish without running out of fuel.

**Simon**: Right. The twist is that you can visit any city more than once, as long as you have the fuel. The challenge also mentions that the number could get pretty big, so we need to return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Mia**: Okay, so let's first think about how we're going to approach this. Given the constraints, a brute force approach would be infeasible, right?

**Alex**: Definitely. With up to 100 cities and 200 units of fuel, brute forcing every possible path would explode in complexity.

**Simon**: I was thinking along the lines of dynamic programming. Maybe we could memoize the number of ways to reach a particular city with a certain amount of fuel remaining?

**Mia**: Makes sense. We could have a 2D DP table, where one dimension represents the current city and the other represents the remaining fuel.

**Alex**: Exactly. And for each city, we would iterate over all other cities and calculate the fuel cost to move, updating our DP table with the number of ways to reach our destination.

**Simon**: The base cases would be critical here. Especially how we handle the destination city in our DP formulation.

**Mia**: For sure, reaching the destination city with any amount of fuel left should count as 1 route, to start with. Then, we add routes based on the transitions from other cities as allowed by the fuel constraints.

**Alex**: Don’t forget to handle the modulo part. In dynamic programming, those operations can get tricky, especially when we're adding or subtracting.

**Simon**: Right, we'll need to apply the modulo operation at every step of our addition to avoid overflow issues.

**Mia**: And what about initialization? We'll need to carefully initialize our DP table to ensure we're not counting any routes incorrectly.

**Alex**: Another thing to consider is how we're iterating over cities and fuel. There's a space optimization trick where we only keep track of the current and previous states to reduce our memory footprint.

**Simon**: True, but for the sake of clarity, maybe we start with the full DP table and then optimize from there. It’s easier to understand and debug.

**Mia**: Agreed. Once we have a working solution, we can look into optimizing. 

**Alex**: Before we dive into coding, let's outline our steps clearly. First, set up the DP table. Second, define our transitions based on fuel consumption...

**Simon**: And third, iterate through all cities and all fuel levels, updating our DP table according to our defined transitions. Lastly, don't forget to aggregate the count correctly for the final answer.

**Mia**: Perfect. Let’s also make sure to test it on the given examples to verify our approach. Sounds like a plan?

**Alex**: Sounds good. This is going to be quite the coding session.

**Simon**: Alright then, let’s get cracking. Thanks, everyone for brainstorming this!
