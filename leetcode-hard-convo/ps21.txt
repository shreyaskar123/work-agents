**Alex:** Hey everyone, glad we could meet up. We've got an interesting problem to tackle - determining if a given string represents a valid number based on a set of rules.

**Jamie:** Right, I've seen the criteria. It seems we'll have to handle several components, including integers, decimals, and possibly an exponent part. How should we approach this?

**Morgan:** I think a good place to start would be to split our validation into different functions for readability. Like, one for checking integers, one for decimals, and one for the overall structure?

**Alex:** That makes sense. So, for an integer, we're broadly looking for an optional sign followed by at least one digit.

**Jamie:** What about decimal numbers? They have a bit more variety in terms of format.

**Morgan:** True. Decimals can start with a digit followed by a dot, a digit-dot-digit format, or just a dot followed by digits. And, of course, the leading sign is optional too.

**Alex:** Exactly. Now, when it comes to the optional exponent part, it introduces another layer. If an 'e' or 'E' is present, it must be followed by a valid integer, right?

**Jamie:** Yes, and it means the preceding part must be a valid decimal or integer itself. It seems like we'll have to check in stages, combining these checks accordingly.

**Morgan:** Definitely. An important part of the validation seems to be breaking down the string correctly. For instance, splitting the input string at 'e' or 'E' if present, then validating each part individually according to its rules.

**Alex:** Good point. Let's not forget edge cases too. Like, a single dot isn't a valid number, but a dot with digits is. Plus, we have to handle the signs properly.

**Jamie:** Speaking of which, how should we handle strings with characters outside of numbers, signs, dots, or the exponent characters?

**Morgan:** Those should automatically invalidate the string. Only the defined characters are allowed, so encountering anything else should return false.

**Alex:** I think we should also consider the length constraint. It doesn't directly affect our validation logic, but it's a good reminder that we're working with relatively short strings.

**Jamie:** Great, seems like we're on the right track. Combining these checks while paying close attention to the sequence and presence of allowed characters should guide us to a solution.

**Morgan:** Definitely! Let's draft up some pseudo-code and run through a few examples to test our logic. We can iterate from there.

**Alex:** Agreed. With a solid plan and careful consideration of the rules, I'm confident we can determine if a string is a valid number. Let's get to it!
