Alex: Hey Taylor, Jamie, thanks for joining me. I've been wrestling with this fascinating problem about calculating paths on a grid that I thought you two might help with.

Taylor: Sure, sounds interesting. What's the setup?

Alex: Alright, it’s a 2D grid puzzle. The grid squares can be one of four types: a starting point, an endpoint, an empty square that we can walk over, and obstacles we can't pass.

Jamie: Got it. So, what's the goal?

Alex: The goal is to return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, hitting every non-obstacle square exactly once.

Taylor: That sounds like a classic backtracking problem to me. Are there specifics about how the grid is structured?

Alex: Definitely, let me lay out an example. Imagine a grid that looks somewhat like this: The top row has the starting point and some empty squares. There’s an obstacle somewhere, not at the edge, and of course, an ending point.

Jamie: I think visualizing it as you described makes sense. What's critical to understand is how to navigate the grid given these conditions, right?

Alex: Precisely. Now, imagine we are tasked with finding out how many unique paths satisfy these conditions. How might we approach this?

Taylor: Well, starting simple, I’d say we first need to explore every possible direction from any given point, right?

Alex: Yes, and considering it’s a 4-directional move setup, we’d have to recursively explore up, down, left, and right, but with some checks.

Jamie: Checks? How do you mean?

Alex: Think about it. We can’t walk over obstacles, and we must traverse each non-obstacle square exactly once. There has to be a way to track where we’ve been.

Taylor: Tracking our path is key, then. We could mark squares we've visited and unmark them if we have to backtrack, ensuring we cover every allowable square exactly once.

Jamie: And I suppose we'd stop and count a path as valid once we hit the ending square, given we've visited all non-obstacle squares.

Alex: Spot on, Jamie. The trick is knowing when to stop and how to avoid illegal moves or revisiting squares. Now, based on what we've discussed, how would you tackle computing the paths without directly programming it?

Taylor: I'd start at the starting square, explore all potential moves, making sure to track my movements and avoid obstacles or repeated squares.

Jamie: While doing that, I’d implement a mechanism to count valid paths, incrementing each time a complete, valid path is discovered.

Alex: Perfect. We’d use recursion for exploring paths and backtracking to ensure we try all possibilities while respecting the grid's rules.

Taylor: Seems like a plan. I’m assuming we should also be mindful of the grid's boundaries to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

Alex: Absolutely. This approach should, in principle, allow us to explore all possible paths and count those that meet our criteria. It’s a problem that combines recursion, backtracking, and some careful condition checks.

Jamie: Great discussion. I feel we’ve got a solid grasp on how to approach this. Thanks for bringing this to us, Alex.

Alex: Thank you both. I knew discussing it would help clarify the approach. Let's code this up and see what we come up with.
