Alice: Hey everyone, glad we could meet up. So, we have this interesting challenge to tackle, the n-queens puzzle. Given an integer `n`, we need to figure out how many distinct solutions there are for placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

Bob: Oh, I remember hearing about that! It's a classic problem in computer science, right? Especially for discussing algorithms and backtracking.

Alice: Exactly, Bob! It’s an ideal problem to apply backtracking. The key here is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column, and moving on to the next columns while checking for conflicts.

Cathy: Conflicts? Do you mean like checking if a queen is placed such that it can attack another?

Alice: Correct, Cathy. For queens to not attack each other, no two queens can be on the same row, column, or diagonal. Whenever we place a queen, we need to ensure it’s not placed in a way that breaches these rules.

David: Wait, so how do we keep track of these constraints? It sounds complicated to constantly check every row, column, and diagonal.

Alice: Good question, David. There are efficient ways to keep track. For instance, we could use three arrays: one for the columns, one for the diagonals, and another for the anti-diagonals. This way, we can easily check if a square on the board is under attack by seeing if its column or diagonals are already occupied.

Bob: Interesting... So, it sounds like we recursively try to place queens column by column, and we backtrack whenever we find that a queen placement leads to a conflict.

Alice: Spot on, Bob! And each time we place a queen successfully without conflicts all the way to the last column, we've found a valid solution. We then backtrack to find all possible solutions.

Cathy: This approach definitely seems doable but also like it involves quite a bit of logic, especially with checking for attacks and knowing when to backtrack.

David: Yeah, and I guess the complexity of the problem scales significantly with `n`, the size of the chessboard. The larger the chessboard, the more potential arrangements and thus, more backtracking.

Alice: Absolutely, both of you are right. The algorithm's time complexity isn't linear due to the nature of backtracking and the increasing number of possibilities with larger `n`. However, for our purpose and the constraint of `1 <= n <= 9`, it's a manageable and interesting challenge.

Bob: It sounds like understanding backtracking deeply and efficiently managing how we check for queen attacks are critical here. I’m curious to dive into the coding part and see how we can implement this algorithm.

Cathy: Me too. And it will be interesting to see how the number of solutions scales with different `n` values. For `n = 4`, there are 2 solutions, but I wonder how many there are for larger values.

Alice: That's the spirit! Let's start by drafting our algorithm on paper, breaking down the problem bit by bit, and then we can proceed to code it. Remember, every challenge we overcome here enhances our problem-solving and coding skills.
