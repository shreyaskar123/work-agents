**Ella**: Hey, everyone! Thanks for joining today’s brainstorming session. We've got an interesting problem to tackle regarding minimum cost path through an array with certain rules. 

**Jamie**: Yeah, I saw the brief. We're essentially looking at finding a path from the first to the last index of an array, with the option to jump up to `B` positions forward, except where an array element is -1, right?

**Ella**: Exactly, Jamie. And we need to find not just any path, but the one that costs us the least in terms of the array values, which represent coins.

**Alex**: And if I got it right, if there are multiple minimum cost paths, we need to find the lexicographically smallest path among those. Sounds like a dynamic programming problem or maybe a graph traversal problem to me.

**Ella**: Spot on, Alex. We could model our array as a graph where each node is connected to the next `B` nodes unless an array element is -1, indicating an invalid step.

**Jamie**: Makes sense. So, our first step would be to construct that graph. Then, we traverse it to find the least costly path. But, how do we handle the lexicographical order requirement?

**Alex**: For the lexicographical order, whenever we find paths with the same cost, we can store them and perform a comparison based on the path indexes. Though, I suppose it would be more efficient to have a strategy that naturally tends towards the lexicographically smaller path as we build it.

**Ella**: That's a good point. Perhaps choosing the earlier steps when presented with options of equal cost could inherently lead to that. 

**Jamie**: I’m curious about how we’ll handle the impossibility of reaching the last index. Some initial validation or condition checks during our traversal?

**Alex**: Right, if during our graph traversal, we encounter a situation where reaching the next index is impossible due to a -1 or the end of our jump length exceeding the array bounds without reaching the last index, we should return an empty array as per the problem statement.

**Ella**: True. Let’s not forget to keep track of the coins spent on each potential path. This means updating our minimum coins spent whenever we find a cheaper path.

**Jamie**: This sounds computationally heavy. Do you think recursion with memoization might help reduce redundant computations, especially if we're doing a look-ahead for `B` positions at every step?

**Alex**: Definitely, Jamie. Memoization or even bottom-up dynamic programming could significantly reduce the number of calculations by storing intermediate results. 

**Ella**: These are all brilliant points, everyone. I think we have a solid handle on the strategy. We'll construct a graph or mimic its traversal, keep track of costs meticulously, favor paths leading us to lexicographically smaller solutions, and use dynamic programming to manage complexity.

**Jamie**: Great, I feel we’ve fleshed out an awesome approach. So, we're not actually coding this right now but laying down our strategy, correct?

**Ella**: That’s right. This meeting is about understanding and planning our approach. We’ll divide the implementation tasks later. Great job breaking down the problem, folks!

**Alex**: Looking forward to seeing this solution in action. Thanks for the productive discussion, everyone!

**Ella**: Thanks, everyone. Let’s regroup once we have some code to review. Good luck!
