**Liam**: Alright, team, we've got this problem where there's a one-dimensional garden along the x-axis, and we have to figure out the minimum number of taps required to water it fully. It sounds like a typical optimization puzzle, doesn't it?

**Ava**: Yes, it does. It's interesting because the taps are positioned at every integer point from 0 to `n`, and each tap has a different range. We should start by understanding how these ranges work and how they overlap.

**Mia**: So, if I understand correctly, the range of each tap is given by the array `ranges`, where `ranges[i]` defines how far from point `i` the tap can water - both to the left and the right?

**Liam**: Exactly, Mia. For instance, if we have `ranges[i] = 3`, that tap can water from `[i-3, i+3]`. Now, the challenge is determining the fewest taps we need to open to cover the entire garden's length, from 0 to `n`.

**Ethan**: This smells like a dynamic programming problem or maybe a greedy one, right? We have to make optimal choices at each step to minimize the total number of taps.

**Ava**: Before jumping to solutions, why don't we brainstorm the constraints? We're given that `1 <= n <= 10^4` and that `0 <= ranges[i] <= 100`. These constraints suggest that we do need an efficient algorithm, but we don't necessarily need something that operates in sublinear time.

**Mia**: I'm thinking along the lines of transforming the problem. What if we considered each tap's effective range as an interval and then worked on finding the minimal set of these intervals that covers the whole `[0, n]` range?

**Liam**: That's a solid approach, Mia. Essentially, we're talking about interval covering or scheduling problems, where we need to choose intervals so that their union covers the entire target interval with minimal overlaps.

**Ethan**: Right, and we probably need to sort these intervals in a helpful manner, right? Maybe by their start points or end points to make it easier to find the optimal overlaps.

**Ava**: Sorting could help, but let's also think about how we choose which tap to open at each step. We might want to open the tap that covers the most ground ahead of us, considering the ground we've already covered.

**Mia**: Agreed. We could iteratively select taps based on how far they extend our reach, ensuring at each step that we're making the choice that maximizes our coverage moving forward.

**Liam**: These are great points. In terms of actually implementing this, we'll need a way to track our current position in the garden and how far we've managed to water. Plus, we should efficiently determine which tap to open next based on our current position.

**Ethan**: Don't forget edge cases, like if it's impossible to water the whole garden. Our solution needs to detect that scenario and return `-1` as specified.

**Ava**: Absolutely. Let's draft this out, consider the pseudo-code, and test it against the examples given, like the garden length of `5` with ranges `[3,4,1,1,0,0]` and so on. This will help us validate our approach.

**Mia**: Starting with the first example will give us a clear action plan. We can adjust our strategy as needed based on those results.

**Liam**: Perfect, let's tackle this problem step by step, considering each tap's contribution carefully. With this methodical approach, I'm confident we can sketch out an efficient solution.
