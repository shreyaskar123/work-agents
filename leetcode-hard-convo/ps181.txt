**Jamie**: So, we've got this problem where we need to figure out the minimum number of swaps to make two anagrams equal. How do you suggest we start?

**Alex**: Right, for strings `s1` and `s2`. First thing, since they are anagrams, we know they are made of the same characters, just in different orders.

**Morgan**: Exactly, and the way to approach this is not to swap any letters but specifically those that contribute to making the strings identical eventually.

**Jamie**: So, it sounds like a brute-force approach where we swap every possible pair of letters would be terribly inefficient, especially since the strings can be up to 20 characters long.

**Alex**: Absolutely. Instead, we should focus on a strategy. What if we start by aligning characters that are already in their correct positions and then address the mismatches?

**Morgan**: That makes sense. So, for a string where we have a character in `s1` that doesn't match the corresponding character in `s2`, we look for the most optimal swap?

**Alex**: Yes, but we have to define "most optimal". This could mean targeting swaps that immediately match characters in both strings.

**Jamie**: Could we do this by comparing the strings character by character, and every time we encounter a mismatch, we find the character in `s1` that matches the one at the current position in `s2`?

**Morgan**: Right, but also keep in mind, we should aim to minimize the swaps. There might be situations where a direct swap isn’t the most efficient path.

**Alex**: True. What if we employ some graph theory here? Where each character position is a node and each swap represents an edge. Our goal is to find the shortest path that leads to a matching string.

**Jamie**: Interesting approach! So, we might also need to consider scenarios where a circular swap might be more efficient than direct swaps. For example, swapping characters in a cycle, rather than a direct swap, might save us some moves.

**Morgan**: Exactly, this could drastically reduce our swaps in the situation where the character arrangement forms cycles among their positions. 

**Alex**: The tricky part would be implementing this. Any suggestions on algorithms or data structures that might help?

**Jamie**: A breadth-first search (BFS) seems suitable for finding the shortest path, considering we're talking about minimizing swaps, which can be thought of as steps or distances.

**Morgan**: And perhaps a way to encode the state of the strings as we make swaps. This could help in tracking our progress and avoiding revisiting the same configurations.

**Alex**: Right, we'd need some efficient way to represent and compare the states. Maybe hashing the string states as we proceed through our BFS?

**Jamie**: Yeah, that could work. Also, we need to ensure we're not just swapping back and forth, so keeping a visited states record would be essential.

**Morgan**: Sounds like we have a rough plan then. Focus on direct and cyclical swaps, use BFS to minimize steps, and carefully track our progress to avoid redundancy.

**Alex**: Exactly. Let's start mapping this out more concretely and see if we can solve some example problems by hand using this strategy.

**Jamie**: Agreed. Those example cases should give us a good sense of whether we're on the right path. Then we can dive into coding this out.

**Morgan**: Perfect. By comparing our manual solutions to the expected ones, it'll give us confidence in our approach before we get too deep into implementation.

**Alex**: Alright, let’s get to it and regroup after we’ve each tried a couple of examples. We'll adjust our strategy as needed based on what we find.
