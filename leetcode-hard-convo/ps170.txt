**Jordan:** So, we've got a bit of a puzzle on our hands with this problem about Alice and Bob playing a game on the chalkboard. Alice wants to win by playing optimally. The initial setup involves non-negative integers written on a chalkboard.

**Sam:** Yeah, it's an interesting problem. It involves understanding how bitwise XOR operations affect the game's outcome. Remember, XOR of all elements resulting in 0 is a crucial part of the strategy here.

**Jordan:** Right. To start, we need to look at the initial state of the game. What does the total XOR of all numbers on the chalkboard tell us?

**Alex:** Well, if the total XOR is 0 at the beginning, Alice wins outright since she starts first. It's an edge case but an important one.

**Sam:** Agreed. Let's also consider the moves. Each player can remove one number at a turn. The goal is to avoid making the XOR of remaining numbers zero.

**Jordan:** That brings up a good strategy discussion. Optimally playing means you need to be aware of potential moves and their outcomes. It’s a game of foreseeing your opponent's moves as well.

**Alex:** Exactly. And since the players take turns, we can assume both play perfectly. Alice, starting first, has to carefully choose which number to remove based on the potential outcome of the XOR values.

**Sam:** I suppose we could run through scenarios or states of the board after each move to predict the outcomes. There's a bit of backward induction involved, right?

**Jordan:** Definitely. Thinking a few moves ahead helps determine the immediate best move. It's crucial to analyze how removing a certain number changes the XOR and the dynamic of the game.

**Alex:** Seems like dynamic programming could offer some insight, especially since we're looking at optimal moves in a sequential game with alternating turns.

**Sam:** True, but let's not forget about the significance of parity. The number of elements and their XOR relationships could hint at who has the upper hand at various points.

**Jordan:** Good point. The overall strategy should adapt based on the current state of the chalkboard. It's more about maneuvering the opponent into a losing position than just focusing on the current move.

**Alex:** Exactly, and considering the game's constraints, there seems to be a pattern or solution strategy that could emerge by thoroughly analyzing smaller instances and seeing how Alice can influence the game in her favor.

**Sam:** Alright, let's start breaking down some smaller examples and see if we can identify any patterns or strategies that could guide Alice to victory. We’ll need to look at different configurations and how the numbers interact through XOR.

**Jordan:** Agreed. This dialogue helps us set the groundwork. Understanding the basics of bitwise operations and strategic play will highlight the path to figuring out the winning strategy for Alice.

**Alex:** It’s complex but solvable with a methodical approach. Shall we dive into those smaller examples and start mapping out possible outcomes?

**Sam:** That's the next step. This approach ensures we consider all possible scenarios Alice and Bob might face, leading us closer to understanding the optimal play strategy.

**Jordan:** Let's get to it then. With some examples and a keen eye on the dynamics of the game, we should be able to outline the steps Alice needs to take to win.
