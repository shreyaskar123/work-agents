**Alex**: Hey everyone, thanks for joining the brainstorm session. We've been tasked with figuring out how to approach this problem where we need to determine the minimum number of days required to disconnect a grid consisting of land and water cells.

**Jordan**: Right, so just to clarify, we're saying a grid is 'disconnected' if there aren't any continuous land cells in either a horizontal or vertical direction. Is that correct?

**Sam**: Exactly, Jordan. And we disconnect the grid by turning a land cell into a water cell. The grid can vary in size but won't be larger than 30 by 30 cells.

**Riley**: First off, we need an efficient way to check if the grid is currently connected or disconnected. How about we think about using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the grid?

**Alex**: Good idea, Riley. If every time we run DFS we only find one group of connected 'land' cells, then we know the grid is still connected. The moment we find more than one group or none at all, it's disconnected.

**Jordan**: Right, but we're looking to minimize the number of changes from land to water. How do we determine which cells to change without brute-forcing every possibility?

**Sam**: I think we need to consider the critical points in the grid. Points that, if turned into water, would either disconnect the grid or not affect its connectivity status.

**Riley**: Critical points would likely be those with the least amount of surrounding land, you're thinking? Like if it's only connected to the rest of the 'land' by one cell.

**Alex**: That makes sense. We should also consider the grid's edges because cells there have fewer neighbors, making them more susceptible to causing a disconnect if changed.

**Jordan**: So, in our algorithm, besides identifying if the grid is connected using DFS, we also need a way to pinpoint these critical cells. Then we assess if changing a particular critical cell disconnects the grid.

**Sam**: And keep in mind, for each cell we decide to 'flood' or turn into water, we need to run the connectivity check again to ensure we've actually caused a disconnect.

**Riley**: It seems like this could get really complex with larger grids. What optimizations can we think of to avoid unnecessary checks or recalculations?

**Alex**: Caching previous states might help. If we've already checked a particular configuration of the grid and know its connectivity status, we don't need to reassess after changing a cell that wasn't a critical part of that configuration.

**Jordan**: We also have to consider that, in some cases, changing just one cell might not be enough, right? Like in the first example, it takes two changes to disconnect the grid.

**Sam**: Exactly, so our solution should probably start with trying to change one cell and iterating up from there, ensuring we check all possibilities in the least number of changes first.

**Riley**: This feels like a mix of DFS for connectivity checking, along with a strategy for selecting which cells to change that minimizes the number of iterations.

**Alex**: Yes, and let's not forget about edge cases, like grids that are already disconnected or grids that are a single line of land which might need a specific strategy.

**Jordan**: Alright, it sounds like we have a decent understanding of the steps required. Let's start by working on each component separately - connectivity checks, identifying critical cells, and optimizing our approach - then we can integrate them.

**Sam**: Sounds like a plan. Let's reconvene after everyone has had a chance to work on their part and see where we stand.

**Riley**: Looking forward to seeing what we come up with. Thanks, everyone.

**Alex**: Thank you all for the input. Catch you in the next session!
