**Mia:** Hey everyone, have you seen the challenge about calculating different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of an array? It seems intriguing.

**Jordan:** Yeah, I came across that. It's quite a mathematical puzzle, isn't it? Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) for subsequences can get complex considering how many there can be.

**Alex:** Definitely. But, if we break it down, it's somewhat about iterating through the array to find all possible subsequences, which sounds like a brute force method at first.

**Mia:** Right, but brute force sounds inefficient here given the constraints. We're potentially talking about over `10^5` elements. That count for subsequences would be astronomical.

**Jordan:** True, Mia. We need an optimized approach. It might help to start by understanding how GCDs behave. Like, if we know the GCD of a set, adding a number to that set can only keep the GCD the same or reduce it.

**Alex:** That's a good point. Also, considering numbers have a maximum value of `2 * 10^5`, can't we use that in some way? Maybe something related to sieving or preprocessing to avoid recalculating GCDs repeatedly?

**Mia:** Oh, preprocessing sounds promising! We could potentially find a way to count unique GCDs without explicitly calculating all subsequences. 

**Jordan:** Yeah, and we should remember how GCDs can be calculated efficiently using the Euclidean algorithm. There might be a way to use that in combination with our preprocessing idea.

**Alex:** Right. What if we also think about the properties of divisors? Like, if we understand which numbers could divide elements in the array, we might reverse the problem. Instead of starting from subsequences, we start from potential GCDs and see if they're achievable.

**Mia:** I like that, Alex! It flips the problem on its head. We could iterate over potential GCDs up to the max value in our array and somehow check if a subsequence can produce that GCD.

**Jordan:** That seems like a much more manageable number of iterations. But we need a smart way to check each potential GCD against the array. Maybe something with multiplication tables or leveraging prime factors?

**Alex:** Exactly, we might need to check how these potential GCDs fit within the array's elements. The challenge would be efficiently verifying each GCD without slipping into a brute force approach again.

**Mia:** So, we're considering preprocessing, smart iteration up to a maximum value, and leveraging number theory concepts like primes and Euclidean algorithm - without outright iterating through all subsequences?

**Jordan:** Precisely. It sounds like a task, but a structured approach tackling these ideas step by step could lead to a solution that's both elegant and efficient.

**Alex:** I agree. Does anyone want to start sketching out a pseudo-code or algorithm outline based on our discussion? We could bounce off ideas and refine as we go.

**Mia:** I'll take a stab at it. Let's regroup in a bit with our ideas and see if we can synthesize a coherent approach from them.
