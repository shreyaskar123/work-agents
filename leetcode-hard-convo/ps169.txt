**Elena**: Alright, team, let's kick this off. We've been assigned this interesting problem about dividing an integer array into two with equal averages. How do we start tackling it?

**Alex**: That sounds like a classic partition problem but with a twist. First, we should probably recall that for two subsets to have the same average, their sums need to maintain a certain relationship, right?

**Jordan**: Exactly. It's kind of like saying the total sum of the array has to be split into two parts that are proportional to the sizes of our subsets A and B.

**Elena**: So, if we get the total sum of the original array, let's call it `totalSum`, then for any subset to have the same average as the entire array, its sum divided by its size should be equal to `totalSum` divided by the total number of elements.

**Alex**: Thatâ€™s a good point. That means we're looking for subsets where `sum(subset) / size(subset) = totalSum / size(original array)`, simplifying that, we just need `sum(subset) = (totalSum * size(subset)) / size(original array)`.

**Jordan**: But remember, we can't just randomly pick subsets. We need a strategy to test combinations efficiently. Recursive backtracking could be a way to generate potential subsets and check their averages.

**Elena**: Right, but that sounds like it could get computationally expensive very fast. Especially considering the constraints - up to 30 elements in the array.

**Alex**: True, but there might be some optimizations. If we sort the array first, maybe we can create early stopping points in our recursion. Plus, keeping track of the current sum and size as we build our subsets could save some calculations.

**Jordan**: And don't forget, once we find a valid subset A, we don't need to find B. Since if A's average equals the array's average, B's average, by default, will match too, considering B is just what's left of the array after removing A.

**Elena**: Alright, we also need to consider the false scenario. What conditions indicate that it's impossible to split the array as required?

**Alex**: That's a bit tricky without giving away the full solution. However, intuitively, if the total sum of the array cannot be evenly divided by any factor that leaves us with two non-empty groups, it's a dead end.

**Jordan**: Agreed. And considering the constraint that every number is an integer, we should also think about the divisibility of the total sum by the number of elements that could potentially form a subset.

**Elena**: So, as a rough plan, we start by calculating the total sum, sort the array for efficiency, and then recursively try to build a subset that meets our conditions, keeping an eye on efficiency and stopping conditions.

**Alex**: Precisely. And let's not forget to add checks for edge cases, such as extremely small or large numbers, or special array lengths that could immediately tell us if the task is possible or not.

**Jordan**: Sounds like we have a solid understanding and a strategy to approach this. Let's get into the details off-line and start experimenting with code.

**Elena**: Agreed. By our next meeting, we should aim to have some pseudocode ready, and maybe even a prototype. Great brainstorming session, team!
