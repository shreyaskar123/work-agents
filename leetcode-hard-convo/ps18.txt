**Alex**: Hey, Taylor, Morgan, do you have a moment to talk about a programming challenge I encountered? It's called the n-queens puzzle.

**Morgan**: Sure, Alex. I've heard about it. It's a classic problem where you need to place n queens on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other, right?

**Taylor**: Yeah, that's the one. Each queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. So, the placement must ensure that no two queens can attack each other in any of those directions.

**Alex**: Exactly! And the goal is to find all the distinct solutions for a given n. For instance, when n=4, there are two solutions. I'm trying to figure out how to approach this.

**Morgan**: It sounds like a problem that can be tackled with backtracking. You try placing a queen in a row and move on to the next row. If you find a row where no safe column exists, you backtrack to the previous row and try a new position.

**Taylor**: Right, backtracking is a systematic way to go through all the possible configurations. For the n-queens problem, you would start with an empty board. Place a queen in the first row, then move to the next row and so on. If you reach a point where no safe placement is possible, you return to the last queen you placed and move it to the next possible spot.

**Alex**: I see. But how do you efficiently check if a queen's placement is safe, considering all the rows, columns, and diagonals?

**Morgan**: You could maintain arrays or sets to keep track of the columns, and the two diagonals. For columns, it's straightforward. For diagonals, you can use a trick. Diagonals in one direction will always have the sum of their row and column indexes constant, and in the other direction, it will be the difference.

**Taylor**: So, if I'm understanding correctly, whenever you place a queen, you mark its column and both diagonals as unsafe for the future queens. And when backtracking, you'd clear those marks for the next attempt.

**Alex**: That makes sense. It sounds efficient instead of checking every possible attacking position for every queen placement.

**Morgan**: Exactly! And remember, for each board configuration that leads to a solution, you'd convert it into the format specified. The board with queens as 'Q' and empty spaces as '.'.

**Taylor**: It's also crucial to note that this problem scales exponentially with n, so the solutions might take a significant amount of time to compute as n grows.

**Alex**: Given n could go up to 9, the computation should be manageable on modern computers. Thanks, Taylor and Morgan; this gives me a solid starting point. I'll start implementing this and see how it goes!

**Morgan**: Happy to help! Remember, debugging and testing with smaller values of n can help iron out any issues in the logic.

**Taylor**: Yeah, and feel free to reach out if you hit a wall or want to discuss your implementation. Good luck, Alex!

**Alex**: Will do. Thanks again, both of you! I'm excited to tackle this.
