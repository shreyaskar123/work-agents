**Alice**: Hey everyone, thanks for joining today's brainstorming session. We've got an interesting problem at hand, related to searching for words in a grid. Essentially, we've been given a board of characters and a list of strings, and we need to return all the words from the list that can be found in the board.

**Bob**: Right, I saw that. Each word must be formed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, but we can't reuse the same cell for a word, correct?

**Alice**: Exactly, Bob. Cells can be considered adjacent if they are horizontally or vertically neighboring.

**Cara**: That sounds a bit like a classic search problem. Do you think we could leverage Depth-First Search (DFS) here?

**Alice**: That's a good point, Cara. DFS could indeed be a viable strategy, especially for exploring all potential pathways for each word through the grid. However, considering each word independently might not be the most efficient approach. Any thoughts on how we could optimize?

**Derek**: Well, what about using a data structure to store all the words in a way that makes it easier to search for them as we traverse the board? Something like a Trie, perhaps?

**Bob**: Ah, a Trie sounds perfect for this scenario. We could insert all the words from the list into the Trie and then traverse the board, using DFS to check each possible word against the Trie.

**Cara**: So, if I understand correctly, as we perform the DFS on the board, we would move along the Trie based on the letters we encounter. If we reach a node in the Trie that marks the end of a word, we know we've found one of our target words.

**Alice**: Exactly, Cara. Also, remember we need to keep track of the cells we've visited in our current path to avoid reusing them. We'd need some sort of mechanism to mark cells as visited and then backtrack appropriately.

**Derek**: Handling the backtracking should be straightforward enough with recursion, right? We could temporarily mark a cell as visited by altering its content and then restore it once we backtrack.

**Bob**: That makes sense. As for retrieving all the unique words we find, do we need some sort of collection to store the results?

**Alice**: Good point, Bob. A simple approach could be to use a Set to store the words we find. Since all words in the input list are unique, our output should reflect that as well.

**Cara**: Are there any edge cases or constraints we should be particularly careful about?

**Alice**: The main thing would be to ensure our implementations handle the board's boundaries properly and don't attempt to explore cells outside its limits. We should also be mindful of the input constraints related to the size of the board and the words list.

**Derek**: Got it. Before we wrap up, should we discuss how we're planning to test our solution?

**Alice**: Definitely, we should test with various board sizes and word lists, including cases where no words are found, and scenarios with larger boards and word lists to evaluate the performance.

**Bob**: I'll start drafting some test cases based on our discussion. We'd want to cover not just functional correctness but also performance aspects.

**Alice**: Great, thanks Bob. This has been a productive session. Let's start prototyping based on our discussion and reconvene later with our initial solutions. Thanks, everyone!

**Cara**: Thanks, Alice. Looking forward to seeing how this turns out. See you all at the next check-in!

**Derek**: Bye, everyone. Happy coding!
