Alice: So, we start by tackling the problem of keeping track of which cells are illuminated at any given time, right?

Bob: Exactly. Given that a lamp illuminates its own cell, plus all cells in its row, column, and diagonals, we need an efficient way to check illumination without literally turning on every cell in those directions. 

Alice: Right. One approach could be using hash sets or counters for rows, columns, and both diagonals. When a lamp is on, it contributes to the count of its row, column, and diagonals.

Bob: That makes sense. For diagonal identification, we could use properties like for any cell \((i, j)\), its diagonal from top left to bottom right has cells where \(i - j\) is constant, and from top right to bottom left, \(i + j\) is constant.

Alice: I see. So we could have hash sets tracking the presence of a lamp in a row, column, and these two types of diagonals. When we add or remove a lamp, we update these counters correspondingly.

Bob: Exactly, and for answering queries, if any of the corresponding row, column, or diagonal counters is greater than zero, that means the queried cell is illuminated.

Alice: Now, for turning off a lamp and its adjacent lamps after a query, how do we efficiently do that?

Bob: We could iterate over the lamp's position and its adjacent positions, checking if a lamp is on there. If so, we turn it off and decrease the corresponding counters for rows, columns, and diagonals.

Alice: For checking a lamp's presence, storing lamp positions in a set could make that check efficient. We'd remove the lamp from the set if it's being turned off, including its adjacent lamps.

Bob: Right, and since the turning off is based on the query position, we need to check all surrounding cells, including diagonally adjacent ones. That’s nine checks in total, including the lamp's cell.

Alice: So after handling a query, we answer based on the illumination check, then proceed to turn off the lamp and its adjacent ones as discussed. This way our solution scales without having to keep an entire grid in memory or check it every time.

Bob: Precisely. It boils down to efficient data structures and understanding the geometric properties of rows, columns, and diagonals. Following this logic should lead to a solution that handles the given constraints effectively.

Alice: Sounds like a plan. Let’s prototype this and run it through some test cases to validate our approach.

Bob: Agreed, let’s code this up.
