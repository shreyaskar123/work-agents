**Alex**: Hey Jordan, could you help me understand how to solve this coding problem I found? It's about finding the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of two arrays.

**Jordan**: Absolutely, Alex. First, let's talk about what a dot product is.

**Alex**: Right, so if I remember correctly, the dot product involves multiplying corresponding entries of two sequences of numbers and then summing those products.

**Jordan**: Exactly. Given that, what's your initial thought on approaching this?

**Alex**: I'm thinking brute force at firstâ€”trying every possible subsequence pair between the two arrays. But I know that's going to be extremely inefficient, especially with the constraints given.

**Jordan**: Good thinking. Brute force could work, but it's not feasible for large arrays. A more efficient approach involves dynamic programming. Have you worked with dynamic programming before?

**Alex**: Yeah, I've tackled a few problems with DP. It's about breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems, right?

**Jordan**: Spot on. In this case, you want to find a recursive relationship for the maximum dot product up to the ith element in `nums1` and the jth element in `nums2`.

**Alex**: Hm, so we're looking at the relation between elements at each position in the arrays. Do we consider elements one by one and compare?

**Jordan**: Precisely. Here's a question to ponder: what happens when you're comparing two current elements, say `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`?

**Alex**: Well, I'd multiply them for sure to get their dot product. But, I guess I also need to consider the maximum dot product found so far?

**Jordan**: That's a critical insight. You'd also want to think about whether including the current pair in your subsequence improves the maximum dot product or not. 

**Alex**: Oh! So, I'd have to compare including the current pair versus not including it and take the path that gives me a higher dot product?

**Jordan**: Exactly. And remember, you're not restricted to including both elements at each step. You can opt to move forward in `nums1` or `nums2`, hence exploring different subsequence lengths.

**Alex**: Got it. And I suppose for the base case in my DP table, I'd look at when either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty, right?

**Jordan**: Correct. The base case would reflect the scenario of not choosing any elements, which inherently gives you the dot product of zero. 

**Alex**: Makes sense. I'd iterate over both arrays then, filling up my DP table based on these decisions, and the final answer would be in `dp[nums1.length][nums2.length]`, right?

**Jordan**: You're on the right track! But don't forget to initialize your DP table thoughtfully to account for negative values in the arrays since they can affect your max product calculation.

**Alex**: Right, considering negative values... I'll be careful with that. Sounds like I've got a solid starting point now. Thanks a ton, Jordan!

**Jordan**: Anytime, Alex. It's a challenging problem but think through the DP approach, and you'll get there. Happy coding!
