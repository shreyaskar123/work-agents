**Liam:** Hey everyone, thanks for coming together today. I wanted to discuss a fascinating problem I encountered that involves arrays of strings. It’s about finding the smallest string that contains each string from an array as a substring.

**Ava:** Oh, that sounds interesting. Could you elaborate on the specifics of the problem?

**Liam:** Sure, let's say we have an array of strings called `words`. Our goal is to return the smallest string possible that contains each string in `words` as a substring. There’s a catch, though: no string in `words` is a substring of another string in `words`.

**Noah:** Sounds like a bit of a puzzle. Do you have an example to help visualize the problem?

**Liam:** Definitely. For instance, if `words` is ["alex","loves","leetcode"], one potential smallest string that contains each of these strings as a substring is "alexlovesleetcode".

**Emma:** Ah, I see. So, we're basically trying to find the most efficient way to concatenate these strings while ensuring each one is represented at least once. What about order? Does it matter which order we concatenate them in?

**Liam:** Great question, Emma. The order you concatenate them can indeed affect the length of the resulting string. However, any permutation that results in the shortest possible string containing all substrings would be an acceptable solution.

**Oliver:** I'm curious about how we might start tackling this problem. It sounds complicated but also like there's a systematic way to approach it.

**Liam:** You're on the right track, Oliver. A good starting point might be to consider how these strings overlap. For example, how might one string act as a bridge to another while minimizing the total length?

**Sophia:** That makes me think this could involve some form of graph theory, where each string is a node, and the edges represent potential overlaps?

**Liam:** Precisely, Sophia! Framing the problem in terms of graphs could lead us to consider algorithms that find the most efficient path or concatenation.

**Jackson:** What about edge cases, though? How could we ensure the algorithm handles scenarios with minimal or no overlap between strings?

**Liam:** Excellent point, Jackson. That’s where we might have to introduce some heuristics or optimizations to ensure we’re not missing more straightforward concatenations in search of overlaps that don't significantly reduce the total length.

**Ava:** It seems like we'll also need to be mindful of the computational complexity, given the constraints on the length of the strings and the number of elements in the array.

**Liam:** Absolutely, Ava. With the array length going up to 12 and individual strings up to 20 characters long, brute force approaches might not be feasible. Finding clever ways to reduce the search space will be key.

**Noah:** This has been enlightening. So, basically, the strategy involves identifying substrings, considering permutations thoughtfully, and perhaps leveraging graph theory to sculpt our solution.

**Liam:** Exactly, Noah. I appreciate everyone's input. This brainstorming session has been invaluable. Let's start experimenting with some of these ideas and see where we get.

**Emma:** Sounds like a plan. Looking forward to seeing how we can crack this puzzle!
