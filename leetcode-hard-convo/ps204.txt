**Alex**: Hey, have you all taken a look at this problem about finding the largest connected component in a graph defined by integers and their common factors?

**Jordan**: Yeah, I glanced over it. It's quite an interesting one. We need to build a graph where nodes represent integers, and edges represent a common factor greater than 1, right?

**Charlie**: Exactly, and then we're supposed to find the largest connected component in that graph. It sounds like a classic graph problem but with a twist because of how we define the connections.

**Alex**: That's the part that seems tricky to me. Any ideas on how we can efficiently identify if two numbers share a common factor?

**Jordan**: I was thinking about prime factorization. We could prime factorize each number and use the prime factors as a way to identify common factors.

**Charlie**: That makes sense. But, considering the size constraints, wouldn't that approach need some optimization to be efficient?

**Alex**: Right, we don't want to factorize each number from scratch. Maybe we could use a sieve-like method to generate a mapping of numbers to their prime factors in a more efficient manner.

**Jordan**: I like that idea. It'll help us avoid redundant calculations. Then, we could use those mappings to quickly check for common factors and build our graph.

**Charlie**: Speaking of building the graph, how are we planning to represent it? Adjacency lists, matrix?

**Alex**: I'd vote for adjacency lists. They're usually more efficient for sparse graphs, which I suspect ours might be, given the condition for connections.

**Jordan**: Once we have the graph, the final step seems straightforwardâ€”traversing it to find the largest connected component. Any preferences on the traversal method? DFS, BFS?

**Charlie**: I think both could work well, but DFS might be a bit simpler to implement in this context, especially for recursively finding connected components.

**Alex**: Agreed. So, our plan is to generate mappings for each number to its prime factors, use this to construct our graph using adjacency lists, and then find the largest connected component with DFS.

**Jordan**: Basically, yeah. It seems efficient and covers all bases. We just need to be careful with the implementation details, especially when generating and using the prime factor mappings.

**Charlie**: Absolutely, optimizing that part will likely be key to handling the larger inputs within the constraints. 

**Alex**: Well, it sounds like we have a solid plan. Let's split up some tasks and regroup after making some progress. I'm curious to see how this will perform with the example cases and more extensive tests.

**Jordan**: Sounds good. I'll start looking into the prime factor mapping and optimization.

**Charlie**: I can begin with the graph construction and think more about how to efficiently traverse it.

**Alex**: Great, I'll focus on integrating our parts and testing. Let's touch base soon and see where we stand.
