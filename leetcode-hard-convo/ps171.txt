**Alex**: Hey, Jamie and Casey, have you two seen the latest problem we're supposed to work on? It's about finding the least number of buses you need to take to travel from a source bus stop to a target bus stop, given a list of bus routes.

**Jamie**: Yeah, I glanced at it. It sounds like a classic graph problem to me, where each bus stop can be a node, and each bus route can be a connection between nodes.

**Casey**: Right. So, we could represent the bus network as a graph. But I’m a bit stuck on how we would efficiently traverse it to find the least number of buses to take.

**Alex**: I was thinking about that. What if we used a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach? You know, starting from the source node and exploring all the reachable nodes layer by layer until we find the target.

**Jamie**: BFS makes sense for the shortest path in terms of edges, which in this case would correspond to the least number of buses to take. But the tricky part is constructing the graph, considering a bus route connects multiple bus stops into a single path.

**Casey**: That’s true. We'd need to map each bus stop to the list of buses (or routes) that serve it. It seems like an adjacency list, but instead of directly connecting stops, we're connecting stops through buses.

**Alex**: Exactly. And once we have that mapping, when we pick a bus at a stop, we effectively “travel” through all stops that bus serves in one step, right?

**Jamie**: Correct. For each stop during our BFS, we look at all the buses we can take from there, and for each bus, we mark all the stops it serves as reachable in one step. Important to note: we should also mark those buses as visited so we don't reuse them.

**Casey**: Oh, I see. It's kind of like expanding our reach exponentially at each step, depending on the bus routes from our current stop. But how do we handle the initial step from the source to the first bus stop or are we considering being at the source as already being at the first bus stop?

**Alex**: Well, the source is just another bus stop, so our initial step would actually involve checking all buses serving the source stop and immediately expanding our reach to the stops they serve.

**Jamie**: And obviously, we keep doing this until we either find our target stop, or we exhaust all options, indicating it's impossible to reach the target, hence we return `-1`.

**Casey**: Makes sense! Finally, we'd need to keep track of the number of steps, in this case, bus rides, we've taken in our BFS, which will increase each time we jump to the stops served by a new bus route we haven't taken before.

**Alex**: And don't forget about corner cases. For instance, if the source is the same as the target, we wouldn't need any buses at all.

**Jamie**: Absolutely. Do we also need to consider any optimizations, given the size of the input? The number of routes can go up to 500, with a sum of all routes' lengths not exceeding 10^5.

**Casey**: Good point. The complexity mainly comes from constructing the initial stop-to-bus mapping and then the BFS traversal. Given the constraints, it seems feasible. But we'll need to code carefully to avoid unnecessary recomputations, especially when marking reachable stops.

**Alex**: Agreed. Let’s start by writing down some pseudocode and identifying any potential bottlenecks. We can optimize as we go. How about we divide the tasks? Jamie, you could work on constructing the graph representation. Casey, perhaps focus on the BFS implementation?

**Jamie**: Sounds like a plan. Let's get to it and regroup in a bit to combine our parts and test it out.

**Casey**: Perfect! Looking forward to seeing this come together.
