**Alice:** Hey everyone, thanks for joining today. I thought we could tackle a programming challenge I came across. It's about finding the largest rectangle containing only 1's in a binary matrix. Any initial thoughts?

**Bob:** Sounds interesting. Are we looking for the area of the rectangle?

**Alice:** Yes, exactly. We need to find the largest rectangle filled with 1's and return its area. For example, if we have a matrix filled with both 1's and 0's, we need to figure out where the largest cluster of 1's forms a rectangle.

**Cara:** Okay, I see. Can you give us a specific example of the input and what the expected output should be?

**Alice:** Sure. Imagine a matrix like this: [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]. The largest rectangle we can form is made of six 1's. So, our output should be 6.

**Dan:** That makes sense. Are there any constraints we should keep in mind while devising a solution?

**Alice:** Definitely. The matrix will have dimensions `rows x cols`, and both rows and cols will be between 0 and 200. Every element in the matrix will either be a '0' or a '1'.

**Bob:** Alright. Should we start by considering brute force solutions and then optimize from there?

**Cara:** Maybe, but considering the size constraints, a brute force solution could be highly ineffective. We'd have to check every possible rectangle, right?

**Dan:** True. I think optimizing from the start might be necessary. Maybe we can use some kind of dynamic programming or stack to keep track of the largest rectangle found as we iterate through the matrix?

**Alice:** That’s on the right track. We might also want to think about how we can break down the problem. Perhaps, consider how we'd solve for a single row and then use that logic repetitively or cumulatively for multiple rows?

**Bob:** So, are you suggesting we transform the problem somehow? Maybe treating each row as a potential base for the rectangle?

**Cara:** I think Alice is onto something. If we can calculate the maximal rectangle for each row considering the rows above it as extensions, we might be able to build up to the solution iteratively.

**Dan:** That sounds promising. It reminds me a bit of the largest rectangle in histogram problem. Perhaps we could adapt a similar approach here?

**Alice:** Exactly, Dan. If we can visualize each row as a histogram, we could potentially reuse solutions to known problems. But we need to figure out how to handle the transition between rows effectively.

**Bob:** Handling the transition seems challenging. We'd need a way to update our histograms or rectangles based on the addition of a new row from the matrix.

**Cara:** Right. It's crucial that we efficiently update our measurements while considering the new row. Can we leverage any data structures for this? Something that helps us keep track of consecutive 1's through the columns?

**Dan:** Stacks might be useful for that, given their efficiency in similar histogram problems. The key would be updating our approach to consider the additional dimension.

**Alice:** Definitely. Let's ponder on this approach and regroup with some pseudocode or algorithms that might work. Remember, we're aiming for an efficient solution that minimizes unnecessary computations.

**Bob:** Sounds good. I'll look into algorithms for the largest rectangle in a histogram and see how we might apply that logic here.

**Cara:** I'll focus on data structures that could help us manage the transitions between rows efficiently.

**Dan:** And I can start mapping out how we would iterate through the matrix and update our 'histograms' with each row. Let’s solve this puzzle!

**Alice:** Perfect, thanks, everyone. Looking forward to seeing what we come up with. Let's reconvene soon with our ideas.
