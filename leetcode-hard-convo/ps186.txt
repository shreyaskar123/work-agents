Alex: Hey, Jamie, have you ever heard about the concept of magical numbers in programming challenges?

Jamie: Hmm, that sounds interesting but no, what's it about?

Alex: It's about finding a specific positive integer that's divisible by either of two given numbers. I came across a problem where you need to find the nth magical number for given integers a and b.

Jamie: Oh, like numbers divisible by 2 or 3 are magical if a = 2 and b = 3?

Alex: Exactly! They also add a twist where you have to return the result modulo 10^9 + 7 because the answer can be huge.

Jamie: Sounds tricky. So, how do you approach finding the nth magical number?

Alex: Well, a brute force way would be to check each number from 1 onwards whether it's divisible by a or b, but that's highly inefficient especially for large n.

Jamie: Right, I assume there's a smarter way to solve it?

Alex: Yes, it involves using the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b to find a pattern. Every LCM(a,b) interval, you'd find a specific number of magical numbers.

Jamie: That makes sense because the LCM of a and b would be the first point where both a and b divide a number.

Alex: Correct! For instance, if we find out how many numbers are divisible by a, how many by b, and then subtract the ones that are counted twice because they are divisible by both.

Jamie: Ah, so it's also important to handle the overlap since otherwise, we would count some numbers twice.

Alex: Precisely. Then, you can use binary search to find the nth magical number within those intervals, making the solution more efficient.

Jamie: I see, binary search because you're essentially looking for a specific 'index' or position of that magical number.

Alex: You got it! And don't forget the modulo operation for the final answer to avoid overflow issues.

Jamie: Interesting. It sounds like a mix of number theory and efficient searching techniques. Would using a specific programming language make it easier?

Alex: Not necessarily, though languages with built-in LCM or GCD functions could save some time. The logic remains the same across any language.

Jamie: Got it. So, understanding the LCM, GCD, and binary search are key to solving this.

Alex: Exactly. It's more about the algorithm than the syntax. Just remember the constraints and the modulo operation.

Jamie: Thanks, Alex! This has been a great mini-lesson. I feel better equipped to tackle such problems now.

Alex: Anytime, Jamie! Happy coding!
