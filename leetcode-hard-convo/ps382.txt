**Mia:** Hey everyone, thanks for joining the brainstorm session. We've got a rather interesting problem on our hands about predicting car collisions based on their speeds and positions. It sounds like a physics mixed with a coding problem, doesn't it?

**Ethan:** Yeah, it definitely does. From what I gather, we're working with an array where each element represents a car, its position, and speed. And we need to figure out when each car collides with the car in front of it, right?

**Mia:** Exactly, Ethan. The challenge here is to calculate the time it takes for these collisions to happen, if at all. Remember, once a car collides, it forms a fleet with the car it collided with, moving at the speed of the slower car.

**Ava:** Do the cars always move in one direction, and can we consider this movement along a straight line for simplicity?

**Mia:** Yes, Ava, the cars are all moving in the same direction along a one-lane road, so we can indeed consider their movement along a straight line, which makes our calculations a bit simpler.

**Liam:** Okay, let's tackle how we can calculate the time to collision. The distance between two cars will decrease over time if the trailing car is faster than the one ahead. The time it takes for the distance to become zero would then be the time to collision, right?

**Ethan:** Right, Liam. The time to collision can be calculated if we know the relative speeds and the initial distance between two cars. But we have to make sure that the car behind is actually faster; otherwise, a collision won't occur.

**Ava:** So, it sounds like we need to iterate through our `cars` array and for each car, calculate the time it will take to collide with the car in front of it. But we also have to consider that any given car might end up being part of a fleet before it collides with another car ahead of it.

**Mia:** Good point, Ava. We have to account for the part where a car may not collide with the one directly in front because it has either slowed down due to a previous collision or the speeds simply don't allow for a collision to occur within our frame of reference.

**Liam:** This means for each car, we need to keep track of which cars or fleet of cars it can potentially collide with, considering their speeds and the time of collision.

**Ethan:** Also, let's not forget the edge case where the last car in our array won't collide with another car since there's no car in front of it. For that car, we should automatically return `-1`.

**Mia:** Absolutely, those are all valid points. Let's also remember that our solution needs to handle a large number of cars efficiently. This isn't just about solving the problem for a handful of cars; we're potentially dealing with up to 10^5 cars.

**Ava:** Efficiency will definitely be key here. We'll need an approach that minimizes unnecessary calculations. Perhaps we could work our way from the end of the array forwards, considering that the state of a car can affect all cars behind it but not ahead.

**Liam:** Sounds like a solid strategy, Ava. By processing from the end, we can adjust our expectations for collisions based on the information we gather about the cars ahead.

**Ethan:** This is shaping up to be an interesting solution. Should we start coding it up and see how our theory stands against some test cases?

**Mia:** Great idea, Ethan. Let's draft some pseudocode and run it through a few scenarios to ensure our logic holds up. Remember, we're aiming to provide an array where each element corresponds to the time a car collides with the next, with `-1` for cars that don't collide.

**Ava:** Sounds like a plan. I'm curious to see how our approach will handle different arrays of cars with various speeds and positions.

**Liam:** With the constraints given, we'll also have to be mindful of our algorithm's complexity to keep it efficient.

**Mia:** Definitely. Alright, team, let's get to work and solve this intriguing problem. Time to bring out your best coding skills.
