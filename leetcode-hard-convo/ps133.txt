**Alex**: Hey everyone, we've been asked to brainstorm a strategy for cutting off all the trees in a forest, represented as an `m x n` matrix, for a golf event. The challenge involves navigating and cutting trees in ascending order of their height. The matrix uses `0` for impenetrable cells, `1` for empty cells, and numbers greater than `1` for trees. Our starting point is `(0, 0)`.

**Jordan**: That's an interesting problem. Are we looking for the most efficient path to clear all the trees?

**Alex**: Precisely. We need to determine the minimum steps required to accomplish this. And, if it's not possible to cut off all the trees, we should return `-1`.

**Sam**: Let's clarify the movement constraints. We can move north, east, south, or west, correct? And we can only cut a tree if we're standing in that cell?

**Alex**: Yes, that's correct. We need to carefully plan our route to ensure we're cutting the trees in the correct order, from the shortest to the tallest.

**Jordan**: I'm thinking we'll need to find a way to sort the trees by their height first, then figure out the path to each tree from the current position, one by one.

**Sam**: The sorting part seems straightforward. The real challenge seems to be calculating the steps to the next tree, especially with obstacles in play.

**Alex**: Right. We also need to consider that some trees might be inaccessible due to the `0` cells blocking the path, as seen in the examples.

**Jordan**: For each tree, starting from the shortest, we could perform a search to find the shortest path to it from our current position. This approach requires dynamic updates to our position and the tree list.

**Sam**: Seems like we're leaning towards a breadth-first search (BFS) for the pathfinding part. It's ideal for finding the shortest path on a grid.

**Alex**: Agreed. We should also keep track of steps taken. And remember, if at any point we find a tree inaccessible, we return `-1`.

**Jordan**: This approach requires a detailed implementation. We'll need functions to sort trees, navigate the grid, and count steps efficiently.

**Sam**: Handling the edge cases will be vital, especially the scenario where a row or column is entirely blocked.

**Alex**: It sounds like we're on the right track. Does anyone have sample questions or details we need to iron out before diving into the implementation?

**Jordan**: How do we efficiently handle the transition from cutting one tree to moving towards the next?

**Sam**: We might need a helper function that not only calculates the shortest path but also updates our position on the grid after cutting a tree. This way, we start each new search from the correct location.

**Alex**: Excellent point. Let's also keep in mind the efficiency of our solution given the matrix size constraints. We should aim for a solution that minimizes computational complexity.

**Sam**: Agreed. Before we start coding, let's outline our approach step by step and identify any potential bottlenecks or areas where optimization might be necessary.

**Jordan**: And let's not forget to test our strategy with different scenarios to ensure it handles all possible configurations of the forest matrix, especially the edge cases we discussed.

**Alex**: Perfect. Let's draft the plan, dive into the implementation details, and regroup to assess our progress and tackle challenges as they come. Great brainstorming session, everyone!
