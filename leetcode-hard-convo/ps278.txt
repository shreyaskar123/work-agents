**Ava:** Hey everyone, thanks for joining this quick brainstorm session. We have an interesting problem to tackle today related to integer arrays. We need to figure out a strategy to find the maximum possible value of an array after possibly reversing one of its subarrays, just once. The value of the array is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Has anyone come across a similar problem?

**Ben:** Sounds like a challenging problem, Ava. Just to clarify, when we talk about reversing a subarray, we’re essentially inverting the order of the elements in that subarray, right?

**Ava:** Exactly, Ben. For instance, if we have an array like [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] and we choose to reverse the subarray [3, 1, 5], the array then becomes [2, 5, 1, 3, 4]. It’s this kind of operation we’re allowed to do exactly once.

**Charlie:** I think an intuitive approach might not cut it here, considering the constraints. We’d need a more optimized solution. Would analyzing the difference between elements before and after a possible reversal give us some insights?

**Ava:** Good point, Charlie. The impact of the reversal on the array’s value indeed hinges on how the differences between elements change before and after the reversal. We should look at examples and identify if there's a pattern or specific points in the array that will benefit most from a reversal.

**Ben:** Let’s take a smaller example to start with. Say, [2, 4, 9, 24, 2, 1, 10]. Reversing different parts might give us a clue on whether there’s a consistent way to identify the most beneficial subarray to reverse. 

**Charlie:** Speaking of identifying parts, are we considering the whole array's state before deciding, or is there an incremental way to assess the impact of potential reversals?

**Ava:** Well, considering the array as a whole might be too broad. We should look for changes or patterns in how the array’s value shifts with hypothetical reversals. Also, thinking about the edges of the subarray to reverse could provide us with a more systematic approach. 

**Ben:** Ah, like checking how the beginning and the end of a candidate subarray compare to the adjacent elements outside it?

**Ava:** Precisely, Ben. That could be a critical part of our strategy. 

**Charlie:** This makes me think about the edge cases too. What about arrays where the maximum value is already present without any reversals, or when the best move is to reverse a subarray that's at the start or end of the array?

**Ava:** Important considerations, Charlie. Let’s not forget to account for those scenarios. It's essential to verify if a reversal is indeed beneficial or if the initial setup is already optimal.

**Ben:** I guess a step-by-step approach to identify the conditions under which a reversal increases the array's value, followed by pinpointing the exact subarray, is the way to go.

**Charlie:** And we’d need a method to efficiently calculate the value of the array, before and after potential reversals, to compare the outcomes.

**Ava:** That’s the roadmap, then. Let’s dive deeper into these strategies, run some simulations, and meet again to discuss our findings and how to implement them practically. Thanks, Ben, and Charlie for the insights. Looking forward to solving this puzzle.

**Ben & Charlie:** Likewise, Ava. See you in the next meeting!
