**Jasmine:** Hey everyone, thanks for joining the brainstorming session today. We've got a rather interesting algorithmic challenge to dissect.

**Alex:** Absolutely, Jasmine. The problem about counting all valid pickup and delivery possible sequences, right? With the condition that each delivery happens after its corresponding pickup, it sounds intriguing.

**Jamie:** That’s the one! And remember, we're looking at scenarios where we're dealing with `n` orders. Seems like a combinatorial challenge at its heart.

**Jasmine:** Correct. To kick things off, let’s consider the simplest case - when `n` equals 1. It's straightforward since there's only one possible sequence: pickup first, then delivery.

**Alex:** Right, and it gets more complicated as `n` increases. For `n` equals 2, the total possible valid sequences jump to 6. The complexity escalates quickly with each increment of `n`.

**Jamie:** That exponential jump hints at a factorial component, doesn’t it? Considering every added order introduces more possible positions in the sequence.

**Jasmine:** Exactly, Jamie. The intuition here is that every new order we add to the problem space multiplies the possibilities. But it's not as simple as calculating `n` factorial.

**Alex:** No, it isn’t. We also have to account for the constraint that each delivery can only occur after its corresponding pickup. This limits the possible positions the deliveries can occupy.

**Jamie:** Right, so if I'm understanding correctly, for every pickup, the delivery introduces a new layer of complexity by having multiple possible valid slots, depending on when it's picked up.

**Alex:** Precisely! And to calculate the total possibilities for `n` orders, we need a formula that considers both the factorial growth and the constraints on deliveries.

**Jasmine:** We also shouldn't forget the problem asks for the result modulo `10^9 + 7`, a common practice to avoid overflow issues with very large numbers.

**Jamie:** Absolutely. Now, if we were to think about an approach, we might start by understanding how to systematically place deliveries after their pickups, and how each choice affects the total count.

**Alex:** Yeah, and we could potentially look at dynamic programming to build up the solution, considering smaller subproblems and how they contribute to the overall count.

**Jasmine:** True. Another angle could be to explore permutations and how each pickup-delivery pair can be slotted into the growing sequence. It’s like a puzzle, where each piece not only fits in one spot but also changes the shape of the puzzle itself.

**Alex:** Hmm, developing a recursive solution might help us visualize the problem, though I worry about the scalability with higher `n` values.

**Jamie:** Well, implementing memoization with that recursive approach could mitigate the performance concerns, turning it into a more viable dynamic programming solution.

**Jasmine:** Great points all around. Let’s start sketching out some pseudo-code to tackle this. Remember, we're focusing on understanding the problem’s structure and potential solutions rather than jumping straight to coding.

**Alex:** Agreed, and by breaking down the problem, identifying subproblems, and considering how to cache results, we'll be on the right path.

**Jamie:** I think this discussion sets a solid foundation. Let’s dive deeper into those strategies and see where it takes us. If we methodically explore these angles, I believe we’ll crack this problem.

**Jasmine:** Absolutely, let's get to it then! Thanks for the productive chat, Alex and Jamie. Looking forward to seeing this solution take shape.
