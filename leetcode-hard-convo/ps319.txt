**Emma:** Hey everyone, thanks for joining the brainstorm today. We're diving into quite an interesting problem about a game Alice and Bob play. Chris, you've got the details, right?

**Chris:** Yes, Emma. So, it's about this game where Alice and Bob take turns removing square numbers of stones from a pile. The person who can't make a move loses. We need to determine if Alice can win given any starting number of stones up to 100,000.

**Jordan:** Got it. So, the strategy each player follows is key to winning, and they have to play optimally, huh? 

**Alex:** Exactly, Jordan. The core of this problem seems to revolve around understanding what it means to play optimally for both players. 

**Chris:** Right. The initial thoughts I have revolve around dynamic programming, considering how previous decisions impact the current state of the game.

**Emma:** Could we also need to list out all square numbers up to a certain limit to see what moves are actually available?

**Jordan:** That makes sense, Emma. Like, we don't need to go beyond the square root of 100,000, since that's the largest pile size we're dealing with.

**Alex:** True. And for each position, we should consider every possible move and see if that leads to a win or loss. 

**Chris:** Yeah, it's like a tree where each node is a game state, and we're trying to find a path where Alice always ends up on a winning node assuming Bob also takes the path most beneficial to him. 

**Emma:** I'm curious about base cases though. We know a pile of size 1 is a win for Alice. How does that information help us with larger piles?

**Jordan:** That's a good point. It seems like for each pile size, we have to ask, "Is there a move that puts the opponent in a losing position?"

**Alex:** So, it's kind of recursive, isn't it? We evaluate the win-lose situation by stepping back through all the possible preceding moves.

**Chris:** Right, and we should probably memoize those results as we go to avoid recalculating scenarios. This could really speed things up given the constraint of `n` going up to 100,000.

**Emma:** Absolutely, memoization will be crucial. Otherwise, we'd be recalculating so many game states. 

**Jordan:** So, to approach this problem, we're looking at generating square numbers, understanding available moves at each state, and employing a dynamic programming strategy with memoization to track win-lose states. Does that sum it up?

**Alex:** Perfectly! Now, while implementing, we also need to be careful about the choice of data structure for storing the memoized results and the square numbers. Efficiency in access and update times will be key.

**Chris:** Agreed. Let's draft out some pseudocode and test cases based on this discussion. And remember, we need to make sure our solution accounts for both players playing with optimal strategies.

**Emma:** Thanks, everyone. This was super productive. Let's regroup tomorrow with our drafts and refine our approach. Good job team!
