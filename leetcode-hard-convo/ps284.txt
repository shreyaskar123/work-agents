**Alex:** So, guys, we've got this interesting challenge about transforming array A, filled with 1's, into this target array using a specific set of steps. How do we even start tackling this?

**Jordan:** Right, the first thing that jumps out is the operation allowed: setting an element in A to the sum of its elements. That's essentially transforming the array step by step towards the target. It sounds a bit like working backwards might help?

**Casey:** Working backwards, interesting... So, you're saying, start from the target array and try to get back to the all 1's array?

**Jordan:** Exactly. If you think about it, the only way to reduce a number in the target array is to have it go back to being a 1, through some series of steps. But we know the immediate step before must have been the sum of the array excluding that number.

**Alex:** That does simplify things. Instead of thinking about building the array up, we consider deconstructing it. But how do we apply this logic in a practical sense? What's the mechanism?

**Jordan:** Consider the largest number in the target array. For us to arrive at that value, its previous value had to be the current sum minus itself, right? That could lead us to a more manageable problem each step.

**Casey:** So, are you suggesting a sort of recursive or iterative process where we keep reducing the largest value by the sum of the other values until we hopefully end up with all 1's?

**Alex:** Sounds plausible. But how do we handle cases where it's impossible to generate the target array? There must be conditions that signal it's time to stop and return false.

**Jordan:** True, we'd need some sort of base conditions. Maybe if we encounter a number less than 1 during our process, or if the sum of the remaining numbers doesn't logically lead to the next step.

**Casey:** Also, wouldn't efficiency be a concern here? Directly applying this process sounds like it could be computationally heavy, especially with large arrays or numbers.

**Alex:** Good point. Maybe implementing a priority queue or some other structure to efficiently find and operate on the largest number could help?

**Jordan:** Definitely, a priority queue could minimize the time spent searching for the largest number in each iteration. The challenge then is to implement this logic cleanly and ensure our iterations are moving us closer to an all 1's array, rather than running infinitely or crashing on edge cases.

**Casey:** This feels like a solid plan. We prioritize reducing the target array, look out for impossible scenarios, and optimize our process to handle larger inputs efficiently. 

**Alex:** Agreed. Let's prototype this approach and run it through some test cases, especially edge cases we theorized about. This will help us validate the concept and refine it further.

**Jordan:** Sounds like a plan. Let's get to it and see how this strategy holds up against the examples given and any other cases we devise.
