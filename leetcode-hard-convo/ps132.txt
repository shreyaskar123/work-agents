**Alex:** Hey, Jamie and Taylor, you both got a moment? I came across this intriguing problem about finding the `k-th` smallest number in a multiplication table. I'm trying to wrap my head around how we can approach this efficiently. 

**Taylor:** That sounds like a pretty interesting problem, Alex. Just to clarify, we're talking about a multiplication table of dimensions `m` by `n`, right?

**Alex:** Yes, exactly. And we're given a specific position as `k`. For instance, if we have a 3x3 table, and we're asked for the 5th smallest number, we need a systematic way to find that without necessarily generating the entire table, I assume.

**Jamie:** Oh, I see. So, for a small table, like a 3x3 or a 2x3, it might seem straightforward to just list them all out, but I guess the challenge comes when `m` and `n` are really large, up to 30000, according to the problem's constraints.

**Taylor:** Right, generating the entire table would be impractical with those dimensions. We'd need to think of a way to determine the value without direct enumeration. Any thoughts on how we could approximate the position of a number in this table without creating it?

**Alex:** I was thinking about the properties of multiplication tables. They are inherently sorted in a way. If you look at any row or column, the numbers increase. Could we leverage that somehow?

**Jamie:** That makes me think of binary search. Normally, we use it on sorted arrays, but maybe we can apply a similar concept here. If we can define our search space somehow...

**Taylor:** You're both onto something. Consider this: if we pick a number `x`, we can calculate how many numbers are less than or equal to `x` in the table. That could help us decide if we need to go higher or lower in our search.

**Alex:** Ah, so it's like iterating through possible values of `x` with binary search, and for each `x`, calculating its rank in the sorted list of the multiplication table. But how do we efficiently calculate how many numbers are less than or equal to `x` without generating the table?

**Jamie:** We'd probably iterate over each row and count how many times numbers up to `x` appear. Since each row is a multiplication sequence, the count in each row for `x` could be derived mathematically, couldn't it?

**Taylor:** Exactly, Jamie. For any given row `i`, the largest number in that row would be `i*n`. So, the number of values less than or equal to `x` in that row would be `min(x/i, n)`, considering we don't exceed the row's limits.

**Alex:** Oh, that's brilliant! That way, we can sum across all rows to find out how many numbers are less than or equal to `x`, and use binary search to narrow down `x` until we find the exact `k-th` smallest number.

**Taylor:** Precisely! And remember, we're working within a defined range â€” from 1 to `m*n`, since those are the smallest and largest possible numbers in the table. That sets our binary search boundaries.

**Jamie:** This approach seems efficient both in terms of time and space, especially considering the large potential size of the table. We never explicitly store it but work within its mathematical principles.

**Alex:** Amazing collaboration, everyone. I feel like we've got a solid handle on this now. I'll try coding this approach and see how it performs. Thanks for the brainstorming session!

**Taylor:** Always a pleasure. Let us know how it goes, Alex!

**Jamie:** Yeah, curious about the real-world performance. Good luck, Alex!
