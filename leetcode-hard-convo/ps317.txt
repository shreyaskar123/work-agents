**Alice**: So, we've got this interesting problem to work on involving 2D plane points and calculating a maximum value based on a given equation. The points are sorted by `x` values, and we need the max of `yi + yj + |xi - xj|` given a constraint on `|xi - xj|`.

**Bob**: Right, the constraint being that the absolute difference between the `x` values of any two points can't exceed `k`. It's fascinating because we have to consider both the `y` values and the distance between points, but only if they're close enough on the `x`-axis.

**Carol**: Exactly, and the sorted `x` values should help us optimize our approach. Since the array is sorted by `x`, we don't need to consider every possible pair, just those within the `k` range, which streamlines the process.

**Alice**: I was thinking about starting with a sliding window approach. We could iterate through the points, and for each one, only consider others that fall within the `k` distance in the `x` axis. The sorting really helps here to avoid unnecessary comparisons.

**Bob**: That makes sense. But we also need a way to efficiently calculate and compare the values of `yi + yj + |xi - xj|` for each potential pair. Remember, we're looking for the maximum value this equation can yield.

**Carol**: For efficiency, could we perhaps utilize a priority queue or some kind of ordered data structure to keep track of the `y` values we're considering within each window? That way, we can quickly access the largest `y` value that has been seen so far and compare it with the current `y`.

**Alice**: Oh, I like that. So, as we slide our window across the array, we would update this structure by adding the new point's `y` value and possibly removing the `y` value of the point left behind, if it falls outside the `k` range.

**Bob**: And at each step, we compare the maximum value we can form with the current point and the maximum `y` from our data structure, along with the `|xi - xj|` value, right?

**Carol**: Precisely. But we also need to ensure we're only computing the equation for valid pairs, meaning we have to check if the points fall within the `k` range of each other.

**Alice**: So, to summarize, our approach involves iterating through the sorted points, maintaining a dynamic collection of potential `y` values we can pair with the current point, and calculating the maximum equation value while adhering to the `|xi - xj| <= k` constraint.

**Bob**: And this should get us the maximum value efficiently, given that the points are already sorted, and we're strategically narrowing down our choices. It's a neat solution!

**Carol**: Absolutely, and considering the constraints and the sorted nature of the input, this method should be both effective and efficient. Now, let's draft a more detailed algorithm and start implementing it.

**Alice**: Agreed, let's get started on coding this solution!
