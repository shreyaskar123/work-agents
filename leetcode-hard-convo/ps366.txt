**Alex**: Hey, I stumbled upon this interesting programming challenge related to arrays and bitwise operations. Do you have a moment to brainstorm solutions?

**Jordan**: Sure, Alex. I'm intrigued. Hit me with the details.

**Alex**: Okay, so we're given an array `nums` with non-negative integers and another array `queries`. Each query has two elements: `xi` and `mi`. Our task is to find the maximum bitwise XOR of `xi` with any element of `nums` that's not greater than `mi`.

**Jordan**: Sounds like a classic problem with a twist because of the `mi` condition. How do you propose we approach this?

**Alex**: First thoughts - for each query, filter elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `mi`, then calculate the XOR of `xi` with each of these elements to find the maximum.

**Jordan**: That works, but iterating through `nums` for every query could get expensive, especially with the given constraints. We might need an optimization. Ever thought about preprocessing `nums`?

**Alex**: Yeah, preprocessing could help. Maybe sorting `nums` first or using a trie to efficiently manage the bitwise comparisons?

**Jordan**: A trie sounds promising for bitwise operations. It could help us query the maximum XOR quickly by matching bits from most significant to least significant, making decisions based on the bits of `xi`.

**Alex**: Right. So we traverse the trie according to the bits of `xi` but also need to consider the condition with `mi`. How do we incorporate that?

**Jordan**: We could adjust our trie traversal strategy based on `mi`. Essentially, if traversing a path where the numbers would exceed `mi`, we backtrack and try the other path, ensuring we only consider valid elements.

**Alex**: Makes sense. And in cases where all elements of `nums` are larger than `mi`, we return `-1` as the answer. This keeps in line with the problem statement.

**Jordan**: Exactly. Another area to be careful about is handling duplicate numbers in `nums`, especially when building the trie, though it might not significantly affect the XOR outcomes.

**Alex**: Good point. Do we need any special data structures for the queries, or is iterating over them with our trie-based approach sufficient?

**Jordan**: Iterating should suffice. Although, sorting queries based on `mi` might offer some preprocessing benefits, especially if we can avoid rebuilding or traversing the trie from scratch for similar values of `mi`.

**Alex**: This approach combines bitwise operations and trie data structures interestingly. I’ll draft a pseudo-code for the trie creation and the query processing. We’ll need functions for inserting numbers into the trie, and another for querying the trie based on `xi` and `mi`.

**Jordan**: Sounds like a solid plan. Remember, the key here is efficiency at each step, keeping the constraints in mind. Optimizations in trie traversal and preprocessing can make a big difference.

**Alex**: Definitely. I’ll work on this and see how we can also optimize space usage, given the potentially large size of input arrays. Thanks for the brainstorm, Jordan!

**Jordan**: Anytime, Alex. Looking forward to seeing what you come up with. Let's catch up after you have the pseudo-code ready for a review.
