**Alex**: Hey folks, have we all had a chance to look over the challenge for today's code review meeting?

**Sam**: Yep, I dove into the problem statement. We need to find the number of ways to form a target string using characters from strings within a given list, following specific rules.

**Jordan**: Right. The tricky part seems to be making sure we track the usage of characters correctly, given we can't reuse characters from the same position or before in any of the strings.

**Alex**: Exactly, we also need to remember to return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`. Now, how do we approach this?

**Sam**: I was thinking about dynamic programming. We essentially break down the problem into subproblems where we calculate the ways to form the prefixes of the target.

**Jordan**: So, for each character in the target, we're looking across all strings and all possible character positions that haven't been invalidated?

**Sam**: Yes, but we also need an efficient way to keep track of which characters are available going forward. The state of our DP could be something like `(position in target, and the index in words we are currently considering)`.

**Alex**: How do we initialize this DP table then?

**Jordan**: The base case seems to be forming an empty prefix of the target, which there's exactly one way to do: by not choosing any character.

**Sam**: After initialization, we iterate through our DP table, filling in the number of ways based on our available choices. For each character in the target, we look at each word in our list and count how many times the character appears in valid positions.

**Alex**: The catch is to remember that once we use a character from a certain position, all positions to the left in any word become unavailable. We need a strategy to mark those positions effectively.

**Jordan**: Yeah, and when we're looking at a specific character in the target, we're essentially adding up all the ways it can be formed from each possible previous state.

**Sam**: Right. The transition function then adds up the counts from all valid positions of the current character to the count of ways to form the previous prefix.

**Alex**: And our result would be the value in the DP table for forming the entire target string, correct?

**Sam**: Exactly, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Jordan**: The final step is to implement this efficiently. We need a good way to iterate through our `words` array and keep track of valid positions without excessive overhead.

**Alex**: Modularity and careful planning of our DP table iteration will be crucial here. Making sure we only consider valid transitions.

**Sam**: Absolutely. We should probably also write some auxiliary functions to clean up the code. Like one to update valid positions as we progress.

**Jordan**: Testing will be important as well. We should come up with some edge cases in addition to the examples provided.

**Alex**: Definitely. Let's each try to implement a solution based on this discussion, and we can regroup to compare approaches and optimization strategies.

**Jordan**: Sounds like a plan. This problem's definitely a bit of a puzzle, but I think tackling it step by step as we've discussed will be the key.

**Sam**: Agreed. Looking forward to seeing how each of us approaches the problem.
