**Alex**: Hey everyone, thanks for joining today’s brainstorming session. We’ve got a fascinating problem to solve related to numbers and rotations.

**Jamie**: Sounds intriguing! What’s the challenge?

**Alex**: We need to figure out how to find all the confusing numbers between 1 and a positive integer N. A confusing number, when rotated 180 degrees, becomes a different valid number.

**Jordan**: Okay, when you say rotated, you mean like flipping the number upside down?

**Alex**: Exactly! But only digits 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9 are valid after a 180-degree rotation. The others turn into invalid symbols.

**Taylor**: Right, so digits like 2 or 7 won’t work because they become invalid when rotated. This reminds me, doesn't 6 turn into 9, and vice versa?

**Alex**: Yes, you've got it. The tricky part is that this rotation may result in a number that looks entirely different. For instance, 69 becomes 96, which is valid, but 29 would turn into something invalid.

**Jamie**: This sounds like it has some depth to it. How do we even start approaching it?

**Jordan**: I’m thinking we might want to start by understanding what patterns emerge when we rotate these numbers. Like, can we classify the numbers based on their last digit, or their length?

**Taylor**: That’s a solid point. Also, since leading zeros are not considered in standard numerical notation, any number ending with 0 would become invalid because its rotation starts with 0, right?

**Alex**: Exactly, Taylor. The leading zero is a good catch. It plays a crucial role, especially in cases where the original number ends with 0.

**Jamie**: So, rotating 10 would ostensibly give us 01, which is essentially 1, making 10 a confusing number because it changes value upon rotation.

**Jordan**: Ah, I see. It sounds like we need to iterate through numbers up to N and check if their rotations give us a valid and different number.

**Taylor**: Don’t forget; we also need to make sure that we are considering the difference in lengths after the rotation. Like with Jamie’s example of 10 rotating to 1.

**Alex**: Good points, everyone. It seems like we’ll need to construct a mechanism to rotate a number, check its validity, handle leading zeros correctly, and then compare it to the original number to see if it’s changed.

**Jamie**: So, for a given number, what would be the steps? First, verify all its digits are valid both before and after rotation?

**Jordan**: Yes, and also constructing the rotated number backward might make it easier to handle the leading zeros issue since we’re essentially ignoring them.

**Taylor**: This sounds like a plan. We need to break down the number, rotate it digit by digit, and then check if the new number is both valid and different.

**Alex**: Exactly. And let’s not forget to keep track of those numbers that meet our criteria. Counting them will ultimately give us the solution to our problem.

**Jamie**: Sounds like a solid approach. Time to dive into the details and start coding this up.

**Jordan**: Agreed. Let’s reconvene with our findings and progress.

**Alex**: Great, looking forward to seeing what we each come up with. Happy coding, everyone!
