**Alex**: Hey, Taylor! Have you got a minute? I need some insight on a problem I've been wrestling with. 

**Taylor**: Sure, Alex. What's bugging you?

**Alex**: So, I came across this puzzle where you have to form a specific target array from an initial array of all zeros. The twist is, you can only increment subarrays by one in each operation. I'm trying to figure out the minimum number of operations needed to arrive at the target.

**Taylor**: Hmm, that sounds intriguing. Could you give me an example?

**Alex**: Absolutely! Consider a target array `[1,2,3,2,1]`. The minimum operations needed here are three. First, you increment the whole array to `[1,1,1,1,1]`, then a subarray from the second to the fourth element to get `[1,2,2,2,1]`, and finally, just the middle element to achieve the target `[1,2,3,2,1]`.

**Taylor**: I see. It's like strategically adding layers to reach the topography of the target array. What about constraints?

**Alex**: The `target.length` is between `1` to `10^5`, and each element in the target array is between `1` to `10^5` as well.

**Taylor**: Interesting. So, a brute force approach likely won't cut it given the array sizes. Have you considered analyzing the differences between adjacent elements in the target array?

**Alex**: That's a path I started down. I noticed that each operation is kind of like "painting" over sections of the array, moving from left to right.

**Taylor**: Exactly! Instead of focusing on what needs to be added to the whole array, concentrate on the increments needed to "step up" or "maintain" the levels as you move along the array. Think of it as a landscape and you're evaluating the effort needed to traverse it.

**Alex**: I'm following you. So, you're suggesting breaking it down into a problem of finding these steps or "differences"?

**Taylor**: Precisely! Visualize how you would walk along the target array's profile. Each step up or plateau represents an operation. It's like asking, how many times do you need to step up or continue straight forward to navigate the entire terrain?

**Alex**: got it! That really simplifies how to approach finding the solution. But, what about the actual implementation? Are we talking about looping through the array, tracking changes?

**Taylor**: It's about smart traversal. Loop through, sure, but keep an eye on the "elevation" changes. A running tally of these changes as you move from the start to the end of the array will guide you to the minimum operations required.

**Alex**: Makes sense. Essentially, it's not just about where to increment but recognizing the pattern of increments needed to reach the target. Any tips on handling corner cases?

**Taylor**: Think about the edgesâ€”starting at zero, any increase is essentially a new "step." Also, how you handle the last element could matter since there's no next element to compare it to. But if you've correctly tallied the steps and plateaus, the end should take care of itself.

**Alex**: This has been incredibly helpful, Taylor. It's less about the specifics of incrementing arrays and more about understanding the structure of the problem. 

**Taylor**: Glad I could help! Sometimes, all it takes is a slight shift in perspective to see the path forward. Good luck with your implementation, Alex!

**Alex**: Thanks, Taylor! I think I've got a solid plan now. I'll start coding this out.
