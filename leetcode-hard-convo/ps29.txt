**Alex**: Hey, everyone, thanks for joining. I think we're all here to figure out a solution to the distinct subsequences problem we've been discussing. Taylor, could you quickly recap the problem for us?

**Taylor**: Sure, Alex. So, we're given two strings, `s` and `t`, and we need to find the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`. A subsequence is essentially a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Jamie**: Right, I remember now. Do we have any constraints we need to keep in mind?

**Taylor**: Yes, both `s` and `t` will have lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and they consist of English letters only. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Chris**: Got it. So, how do you guys propose we approach this problem? I was thinking about using dynamic programming.

**Alex**: Dynamic programming sounds like a solid approach, Chris. Specifically, we could use a 2D table to keep track of our calculations. For each position in `s` and `t`, we determine if it contributes to the final count of subsequences.

**Taylor**: That's a good start. To be more precise, we could iterate through each character in `s` and `t`. For each pair of positions, we decide if we should include the character from `s` in our subsequence or not, based on whether it matches the current character in `t`.

**Jamie**: I see where this is going. So, it's like, if the characters match, we have two choices: either we include that character as part of our subsequence or we skip it. But if they don't match, our only option is to skip the character in `s`. Is that right?

**Chris**: Exactly, Jamie. And don't forget, when we decide to include the character, we should also consider the number of distinct subsequences up to that point. It's all about accumulating the count as we progress through `s` and `t`.

**Alex**: Seems like the challenge would be in efficiently updating and accessing the counts as we move through the characters. We'd have to carefully update the 2D table to ensure we correctly accumulate the total number of distinct subsequences.

**Taylor**: One thing to note is the importance of initializing our table correctly. For instance, if `t` is an empty string, there's exactly one subsequence of any string `s` that matches it, which is the empty subsequence.

**Jamie**: Right, and I suppose we'd need to iterate over the lengths of `s` and `t` in nested loops to fill out our table, making sure to obey the constraints of the problem.

**Chris**: And once we've filled the table, our answer would be at the last cell, which represents the total count of distinct subsequences of `s` that equals `t`.

**Alex**: Perfect. It looks like we have a pretty solid understanding of how to tackle this problem using dynamic programming. Let's start implementing our approach and see if we encounter any issues along the way. Thanks for the productive discussion, everyone!

**Taylor**: Sounds like a plan. Let's regroup later and share our progress or any challenges we might face. Good luck, everyone!
