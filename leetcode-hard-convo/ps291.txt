**Alex**: Hey everyone, I stumbled upon this interesting problem about optimizing a team's performance given each member's speed and efficiency. We need to find the best combination of up to `k` engineers to maximize the team's performance. The performance is calculated based on their combined speeds and the minimum efficiency among them. Any thoughts on how to approach this?

**Jordan**: That sounds like a fun challenge. First, we must understand how the performance metric works. The total speed is straightforward, but the minimum efficiency will significantly impact the result. My initial thought is that we should sort the engineers in some way to make the selection process more manageable. 

**Taylor**: Sorting sounds like a great starting point. Perhaps we could sort the engineers based on their efficiency since the minimum efficiency in a team defines the efficiency multiplier for the team's performance.

**Morgan**: I agree with sorting by efficiency, but I think it should be from highest to lowest. This way, we ensure that when we pick a team of `k` members, we're looking at engineers with the highest possible efficiencies first.

**Alex**: That makes sense. After sorting them by efficiency, how do we decide which engineers to include in the team to maximize the speed?

**Jordan**: We might need to iterate through the sorted list and maintain a running sum of the speeds. However, since we're restricted to selecting at most `k` engineers, we could use a priority queue or something similar to keep track of the top speeds.

**Taylor**: Exactly, and every time we add an engineer to our current team, we calculate the team's performance by multiplying the total speed by the current engineer's efficiency (since after sorting, the current engineer's efficiency would be the minimum for the team so far). 

**Morgan**: Don't forget we have to handle situations where adding an engineer might not be beneficial. If adding a new engineer doesn't increase the overall performance, we should be able to skip or remove the one with the lowest speed to try and maximize our performance score.

**Alex**: Right, so it's like a sliding window of size `k` where we continuously update our team composition to ensure maximum performance. 

**Jordan**: And because the numbers can get huge, we must remember to return the result modulo 10^9 + 7. 

**Taylor**: Looks like we have a decent plan for solving this problem. We sort the engineers by efficiency, iterate through them while maintaining a group of up to `k` engineers with the highest speeds, and calculate the performance at each step to find the maximum.

**Morgan**: This problem is a nice blend of sorting, priority queues, and sliding windows techniques. Implementing this efficiently will be key.

**Alex**: Thanks, everyone, for brainstorming this. I feel like we've got a solid understanding of how to approach it. Let's get to coding and see how we can make this work.
