**Alex**: Alright team, let's discuss the new requirement for a 'FreqStack', a stack that pops the most frequent element. Any initial thoughts on how we tackle this?

**Jordan**: It sounds like a typical stack, but with an emphasis on tracking the frequency of each element. We could use a hashmap to keep track of the counts.

**Riley**: Yeah, and maybe we need another structure to keep an eye on the elements' order and frequency. Something that lets us quickly identify the most frequent element that's closest to the top...

**Alex**: Precisely. The hashmap Jordan mentioned could map each element to its frequency. But, Riley, for the structure you're hinting at, what if we map frequencies to a stack of elements that have that frequency? It would let us know the order of insertion too.

**Jordan**: Oh, so each time we push an element, we update the count in our frequency map, and then push the element to the stack that corresponds to its updated frequency.

**Riley**: I see where you're going. And for the `pop` function, we'd look for the stack with the highest frequency that's not empty, pop an element from it, and then update our frequency map correspondingly.

**Alex**: Right. That addresses the requirement of popping the most frequent and the most recent element in case of a frequency tie. But, how do we efficiently track the stack with the current highest frequency?

**Jordan**: We could keep a variable to store the current max frequency at any time. Every push operation could update this max frequency if necessary.

**Riley**: Makes sense. But, during pop, reducing an element's frequency might also reduce the max frequency, especially if we pop the only element at that highest frequency.

**Alex**: True, that complicates things a bit. We'd have to check if we need to adjust the current max frequency down after a pop. Any suggestions on how to handle that gracefully?

**Jordan**: It might not be that bad. If we're popping from the highest frequency stack, and it becomes empty, we know the max frequency has to decrease. Since our operations revolve around pushing and popping, and we're only increasing frequency by one on each push, it simplifies the logic for adjusting the max frequency.

**Riley**: So, the operations hinge on meticulous bookkeeping. We track each value's frequency, maintain stacks for each frequency, and keep an eye on the max frequency. It sounds resource-intensive but manageable.

**Alex**: Exactly, the complexity seems tied more to the bookkeeping than the algorithm's logic itself. Let's code this up carefully, ensuring we manage our data structures well to keep operations optimal. Good brainstorming, everyone. Let's get to implementing and then we can review our approach again with some test cases.

**Jordan**: Sounds good. I'll focus on the push operation implementation.

**Riley**: And I'll start working on the pop operation. Let's sync up after to make sure everything integrates smoothly.
