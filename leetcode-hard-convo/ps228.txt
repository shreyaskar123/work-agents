**Alex:** Hey Jordan, have you had a chance to look into that string problem I mentioned this morning?

**Jordan:** Yeah, the one about finding the shortest string that includes two given strings as subsequences, right?

**Alex:** Exactly, that one. I've been thinking it might involve some kind of dynamic programming.

**Jordan:** That was my first thought too. Specifically, we could use a 2D table to keep track of our progress while trying to merge these strings, keeping the subsequences intact.

**Alex:** Do you think we should compare the characters of `str1` and `str2` and build from there?

**Jordan:** Correct. If the characters match, it's straightforward—we just add that character to our result because it'd be part of the shortest common supersequence. But if they don't match, then we might have to make a choice where we'd need some way to backtrack the optimal path, right?

**Alex:** Ah, so that's where the dynamic programming table would come in handy. Each cell could help us decide the next step based on minimizing the length of the supersequence.

**Jordan:** Exactly! We can use the table to remember decisions that lead to the shortest overall length. We'll have to initialize it with some sensible values that reflect the cost of adding characters from either `str1` or `str2`.

**Alex:** Makes sense. I assume the table's size would be related to the lengths of `str1` and `str2`. How do we initialize it, though? With zeros?

**Jordan:** Actually, an interesting approach is to initialize it in a way that reflects the incremental cost of building a sequence from each string independently. This way, the table's edges effectively represent the cost of constructing the sequence from one string alone while ignoring the other.

**Alex:** And I guess, during the process, we'd choose the path that minimizes the length of our resulting string. This must involve some comparison and selection at each step when the characters don't match.

**Jordan:** Spot on. When we reach the end, the bottom-right cell of the table should give us the length of the shortest common supersequence. But there's a bit more...

**Alex:** Oh, right, we'd need to actually build the string, not just know its length. I suppose we can do that by backtracking from that bottom-right cell?

**Jordan:** Precisely. By backtracking, we can reconstruct the sequence by making choices that led to the optimal solution, effectively going backwards through our decision-making process.

**Alex:** That sounds like a solid approach. What about complexity? I'm guessing it's not too trivial with dynamic programming involved.

**Jordan:** It's primarily governed by the size of the input strings, so I'd say the time complexity is quadratic. Space complexity is in the same boat because of the 2D table.

**Alex:** Alright, I feel like I've got a good grasp on how to tackle this. I'll give it a shot and maybe write some pseudo-code before diving into the actual coding.

**Jordan:** Sounds like a plan. Don't hesitate to bounce ideas off me if you hit a snag or want to validate your approach. It’s a tricky problem but a great exercise for dynamic programming.

**Alex:** Will do. Thanks for breaking it down with me, Jordan!
