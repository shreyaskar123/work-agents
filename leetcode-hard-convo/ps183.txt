**Alex:** Hey folks, glad we could gather here. So, we're looking to solve this programming challenge I stumbled upon. It's about finding the length of the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`. Any thoughts on how we should approach this?

**Jordan:** That’s an interesting problem, Alex. My first thought is to maybe look into sliding window algorithms or two-pointer techniques. They’re quite effective for contiguous subarray problems.

**Casey:** I agree with Jordan. However, considering the subarray sum could be positive or negative, it adds a layer of complexity. Maybe prefix sums could help us keep track of the cumulative total up to each index?

**Alex:** Right, prefix sums sound like a promising direction. But, how can we efficiently find the shortest length once we have those sums?

**Jordan:** Well, we could try maintaining a deque or some sort of data structure to help with that. The goal would be to keep it in increasing order of the prefix sums but also ensure we can quickly find potential candidates for our solution.

**Casey:** Hm, finding candidates quickly is key. So, essentially, for each new prefix sum we encounter, we should look back at our data structure to find the smallest sum earlier that still meets the criteria of being at least `K` less than our current sum, correct?

**Alex:** Exactly, Casey. That difference being at least `K` essentially forms our required contiguous subarray. Also, remember we need to return the length, so we'll need to account for the indices somehow in our approach.

**Jordan:** Don't forget edge cases, though. What if the array has all negative numbers, or if we can't find a subarray with a sum `>= K`? We need to ensure our solution gracefully returns `-1` in those scenarios.

**Casey:** Absolutely, error handling is crucial. We'll be iterating over each element at least once, so what do you guys think about the time complexity here?

**Alex:** Ideally, we keep it linear. If we smartly update our data structure and only loop through the array once, while possibly doing constant time operations for each element, we should be good.

**Jordan:** Makes sense. It sounds like we've sketched out a pretty solid plan. Iterate through the array once, calculate prefix sums, maintain a data structure for efficiently finding the shortest qualifying subarray. 

**Casey:** And, of course, edge case management. Can't forget about that. Sounds like this will need a bit of careful coding to get everything working together smoothly.

**Alex:** Totally. Let's break this down into tasks and tackle each part. We can reconvene to review our implementation and test it against some sample inputs. Excited to see how it turns out!

**Jordan:** Same here! Let’s get coding and help Alex solve this puzzle. I’m curious to see how our theoretical approach translates into code.

**Casey:** Agreed. Let's meet later and test our solution comprehensively. Looking forward to a productive session!
