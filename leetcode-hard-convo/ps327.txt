**Alex:** So, I've been pondering how to tackle this problem about finding the maximum length awesome substring. We're dealing with palindromes and swaps here. 

**Jordan:** Right. The essence seems to lie in understanding what constitutes a palindrome and how swaps could impact it. Given the constraints, we're looking at a problem that requires optimization to handle potentially large strings.

**Casey:** Precisely. For a palindrome, symmetry is key. Each character towards the start has a matching character towards the end. But, an odd-length palindrome can have one unique character in the middle.

**Alex:** That's a valid point, Casey. It means we must account for substrings of both even and odd lengths. The difference in handling these two scenarios could be crucial in devising a strategy.

**Jordan:** Let's not overlook the fact that we're dealing with digits here. Does that simplify our approach, given the finite set of characters?

**Casey:** It might, Jordan. Since there are only 10 different characters (0-9), we can utilize some form of counting or hashing to keep track of the characters' frequencies.

**Alex:** I'm thinking about a sliding window or two pointers technique to explore the substrings. But the challenge is identifying those substrings that can eventually form a palindrome through swaps.

**Jordan:** Yeah, and those swaps hint at playful manipulation of frequencies. If every character count is even, or all but one are even, we're looking at a potential palindrome, right?

**Casey:** Exactly, Jordan. But iterating through all possible substrings and checking their swap potential seems inefficient. We need a smarter way to track changes in character frequencies as we explore the string.

**Alex:** That brings us to prefix sums or maybe some bitwise manipulation to represent the frequency states efficiently. Given the constraint up to `10^5`, we need to keep operations to a minimum.

**Jordan:** I wonder if there's a dynamic programming aspect to this. Or perhaps a more nuanced data structure that helps us quickly identify potential awesome substrings.

**Casey:** We should also consider the edge cases, such as strings composed entirely of the same digit or strings with no possible palindrome substrings. They could offer insights into shortcuts or optimizations for our solution.

**Alex:** Agreed. So, our strategy involves understanding palindrome formation, efficient character frequency tracking, and optimizing the exploration of potential substrings.

**Jordan:** Yeah, and dealing with the nuances of odd and even-length palindromes, possibly leveraging the digit limitation to our advantage.

**Casey:** It's a complex problem, but breaking it down like this makes it seem more approachable. We’ll need to experiment with different approaches and see what works best given the constraints.

**Alex:** Indeed. Let’s draft some pseudocode based on these strategies and start experimenting. Testing with the provided examples should give us a good starting point for validation.
