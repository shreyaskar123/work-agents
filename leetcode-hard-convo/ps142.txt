**Alice:** Hey everyone, let's discuss how we could design and implement a Range Module that tracks ranges of numbers. Our goal is to create efficient interfaces for adding, querying, and removing ranges. Any initial thoughts?

**Bob:** Well, first, we need a way to store the ranges. Considering we want efficiency, maybe a data structure that keeps the ranges sorted and allows for quick lookups and updates.

**Charlie:** Right, I was thinking along the lines of using a tree structure, perhaps a balanced binary search tree. This could help with keeping the intervals sorted and makes it easier to manage overlaps when adding new ranges.

**Alice:** That's a good point, Charlie. A balanced binary search tree could work well. For the addRange operation, how do you suggest we handle overlaps?

**Diana:** We could start by finding where the new range should be inserted. If it overlaps with existing ranges, we merge them into a single, larger range. This means adjusting the start and end of the overlapping ranges accordingly.

**Bob:** Querying a range seems straightforward with this structure. We would just have to check if each sub-range within the queried range is tracked, right?

**Charlie:** Exactly. But we need to be efficient. We can't naively check every number in the range. We'd utilize the property of our tree to quickly determine if the entire range is covered without checking each number.

**Alice:** Now, removing a range might be a bit trickier, considering it could split an existing range into two or more parts.

**Diana:** True, for removeRange, we need to find the interval(s) that intersect with the range to be removed and adjust their boundaries or split them if necessary. It could result in removing a part of an interval or the entire interval, potentially splitting it into two intervals at times.

**Bob:** Yeah, and for all these operations, we should be mindful of the need to rebalance the tree if we're going with a balanced binary search tree, to maintain the efficiency of operations.

**Alice:** Great points, everyone. Let's not forget about space efficiency as well. While adding ranges, we should only store unique intervals, combining any that overlap to avoid unnecessary space usage.

**Charlie:** Definitely. It seems we have a good starting point for our implementation. We'll need to carefully consider how to efficiently implement these methods, especially handling the complexities of overlapping intervals.

**Diana:** I agree. Let's start prototyping based on this discussion. We can adjust our approach as needed once we see how it performs with actual data.

**Alice:** Sounds like a plan. Let's reconvene after some initial coding to review progress and tackle any issues that come up. Great brainstorming session, everyone!
