**Alex:** Hey Jamie, have you seen the latest problem we need to solve? It's about finding the least time a person can swim from the top left square to the bottom right in a grid after the rain starts.

**Jamie:** Oh, yeah, I saw that. We’re basically dealing with an N x N grid where each square has an elevation, right?

**Alex:** Exactly. The whole trick is that the depth of the water rises uniformly, and you can move from one square to another if their elevations are at or below the water level. You can only move to squares that are directly adjacent to you in one of the four cardinal directions, though.

**Jamie:** So, essentially, we need to figure out the minimum time at which the elevations of both the starting square and the destination are below the water level, while also ensuring there's a path through adjacent squares under water?

**Alex:** Yeah, and remember, the grid is bounded, so the swimmer can't go outside it. It seems like we need to find a way to track the elevations and the progression of time to see when the destination becomes reachable.

**Jamie:** It sounds like we need a form of search or BFS to explore the grid as it gets submerged. Maybe prioritizing exploration based on the elevation and time?

**Alex:** That's a potential strategy. We'll probably need some sort of priority queue to manage which square to explore next based on the current water level.

**Jamie:** But we also need to avoid revisiting squares unnecessarily. I wonder if we could use a visited matrix or something similar to keep track of where we’ve been and what the water level was when we checked it.

**Alex:** Good point. This could prevent the algorithm from wasting time on squares that it has already evaluated for a given or lower time.

**Jamie:** Have you thought about how to handle the elevation constraint? We need a way to check that a square's elevation is at most ‘t’ before moving onto it.

**Alex:** Yeah, we could check adjacent squares' elevations against the current water level as we perform our search. If the square's elevation is less than or equal to ‘t’, it’s a valid move.

**Jamie:** Okay, that makes sense. So, essentially, we increment time, expanding our reachable area bounded by the increasing water level, and checking for the first time our destination is within reach.

**Alex:** Exactly. I think the main challenge will be optimizing the search so it runs efficiently on larger grids. We’ll probably need to test it out with different inputs to make sure it behaves as expected.

**Jamie:** Definitely. Should we start sketching out some pseudocode to outline our approach more concretely?

**Alex:** Great idea. Let’s start with defining our grid, initializing our data structures for visited squares, and setting up our priority queue for the search. Then we can work on the search logic and how we’ll handle the elevation and time constraints.

**Jamie:** Sounds like a plan. This is an interesting problem - I’m curious to see how our solution will perform!
