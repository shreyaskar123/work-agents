**Alex**: Hey everyone, thanks for joining the brainstorming session today. We've got a fascinating problem to tackle related to painting a grid with certain constraints. The task is to paint each cell of an `n x 3` grid with one of three colors - Red, Yellow, or Green - ensuring no two adjacent cells share the same color.

**Jordan**: Right, so essentially, we're looking for the number of possible configurations given these constraints. I assume we're considering both vertical and horizontal adjacency here?

**Alex**: Exactly, Jordan. No two cells that are directly next to each other, either on the same row or column, can have the same color.

**Morgan**: Sounds like a classic DP (Dynamic Programming) problem. Given `n` - the number of rows - we should calculate how colors can be placed without violating the rules. Any thought on the base cases?

**Jordan**: Well, for a single row of 3 cells, there aren't any adjacency constraints from previous rows. We're free to paint as long as the three cells in that row don't repeat colors. Have we identified how many unique ways we can paint a single row?

**Alex**: That’s a good starting point. Consider each cell in the row can take a color different from its neighbor. For the first cell, we have three color options; for the second cell, we have two since it cannot be the same as the first; and for the third, it also cannot match the second, leaving two options. 

**Morgan**: So, for a one-row scenario, the calculation seems straightforward. The complexity comes in when adding additional rows since the choice for the first row affects the second and so on.

**Jordan**: Right. Now, considering the second row, we need to account for the color arrangement of the row above. Each color placement in the second row depends on the configuration of the colors in the first row.

**Alex**: Exactly, and thus, we approach this with a mindset of enumerating possibilities row by row, taking into account the prior row's configuration to ensure our constraints hold. 

**Morgan**: Sounds like we need to keep track of states or patterns that emerge from row to row. If we can categorize these patterns, we could potentially simplify our calculations by understanding how to transition from one pattern to another.

**Jordan**: Do we have a formula or relation in mind that could help us transition these states efficiently? It sounds like the type of problem where we could greatly benefit from identifying a recursive relationship.

**Alex**: Without diving too deep into specific solutions, a recursive relationship would likely involve understanding how many ways you can paint the current row based on how you painted the previous one. And then, of course, we'll need a way to calculate this efficiently for a large `n`.

**Morgan**: I imagine the solution involves some form of memoization or tabulation to avoid recalculating state transitions for each row.

**Jordan**: Right, avoiding recomputation is key here. Also, considering the problem's constraints, any solution we come up with would need to handle the large `n` values gracefully. 

**Alex**: Absolutely, and let’s not forget, the final answer needs to be computed modulo `10^9 + 7` to manage the large numbers we're bound to encounter.

**Morgan**: It sounds like we have a decent understanding of the problem's structure and some potential approaches to tackle it. Maybe our next step is to draft up some pseudo-codes and test cases?

**Jordan**: Agreed. Let’s start mapping out some patterns and potential recursive formulas. We might find a pattern to exploit or a simplification for the transitions between rows.

**Alex**: Great, let's reconvene with some initial algorithms and see where we can optimize. Thanks for the productive discussion, everyone.
