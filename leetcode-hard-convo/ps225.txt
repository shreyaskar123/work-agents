**Elena:** Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining the brainstorming session today. I think we have a unique challenge, focusing on finding the occurrence of a specific digit in a range. Just to make sure, we're not implementing solutions here, right? Just walking through ideas?

**Marvin:** Correct. No direct solutions. Think of it as a puzzle to guide someone through its thinking process. So, the task is about counting how many times a digit occurs between two numbers.

**Theo:** Right. Let's start by understanding the problem better. We're given a digit `d`, which lies between `0` and `9`. Then, we have a lower and an upper bound. Our goal is to count instances of `d` within this range, inclusive.

**Aisha:** Seems straightforward. But, it also sounds like it might involve a lot of iterations if we're talking about a range within `1` to `2×10^8`. How do we optimize our approach?

**Elena:** Let's not jump into optimization yet. First, how would you approach this problem fundamentally? 

**Marvin:** I'd say the brute-force approach involves iterating through each number in the range, converting it to a string, and then counting occurrences of `d`. 

**Theo:** That’s a good start. But as Aisha mentioned, it could be costly for large ranges. Can we think of a way to break down the problem, maybe mathematically?

**Aisha:** Yeah, a mathematical approach could involve understanding the frequency of each digit at each positional place value within the range. Like, how often does `d` appear in the unit place, the tens place, and so on...

**Elena:** I see where you're going. It's about identifying patterns in numbers and considering how digits repeat within positional places over specific intervals.

**Marvin:** Exactly. For instance, for a less complex example, if we're looking at a single-digit range, we can straightforwardly say `d` will appear once. But as we expand that range, we'll notice a cyclic pattern in the appearance of digits.

**Theo:** Right, and if we can calculate the frequency of those cycles, it could lead to a more direct calculation without iterating through each number.

**Aisha:** It also sounds like there's a significant difference in approach when `d` is `0` versus when it's any other digit, given that leading zeros are usually not considered in real-world numeration.

**Elena:** Precisely. We'd need to consider special cases like that. So, broadly speaking, we're looking at dissecting the number range into comprehensible segments and applying pattern recognition to minimize literal counting.

**Marvin:** And we must not forget edge cases, such as when `low` and `high` are the same or when they include numbers with multiple instances of `d`.

**Theo:** Absolutely, those nuances could affect our tally. Well, it looks like we have a solid conceptual framework. It involves understanding numerical patterns, applying basic combinatorial principles, and being careful with edge cases.

**Aisha:** Definitely a problem that requires a bit more than a cursory glance. It seems like it would be a rewarding challenge to code.

**Elena:** Thanks, everyone, for this insightful discussion. Let's reconvene after we've all had some time to mull over the specifics of implementing our ideas. Remember, it's about guiding through the thought process, not just providing an outright solution.

**Marvin, Theo, Aisha:** Agreed. Thanks!
