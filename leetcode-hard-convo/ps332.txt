**Max:** Hey, I heard you've been trying to figure out this sequence game where Alice scores points based on the remaining row of stones. Sounds like a great algorithm challenge!

**Jordan:** Yeah, exactly. I've been trying to wrap my head around how to approach it. Any thoughts?

**Max:** Well, first off, it seems critical to understand how to divide the stones to maximize Alice's score. You're given an array of integers representing the stone values, right?

**Jordan:** Correct. And each round, Alice can split this array into two non-empty arrays, and based on the sums, one is discarded, and the score is updated.

**Harper:** So, it sounds like you need to think about all possible ways to split the array in each round. Have you considered using recursion to explore these splits?

**Jordan:** I did think about recursion, but I'm a bit stuck on how to implement it without brute-forcing every possible outcome.

**Max:** Brute force would be too slow given the problem constraints. Perhaps a dynamic programming approach could work here. You'd essentially be caching the results of each split to avoid recalculating them.

**Jordan:** Makes sense. But how would I structure my dynamic programming table in this context?

**Harper:** Imagine a table where each cell represents the maximum score that can be obtained from a sub-array of the stone values. You'll need to update this table based on the game's rules â€“ essentially deciding the optimal split at each step.

**Max:** Right, and don't forget about the condition where if the sums of the stones of both rows are equal, Alice gets to choose which one is thrown away. That adds a bit of a twist to your DP solution.

**Jordan:** Oh, right. So, in that case, I'd need to account for potentially different strategies for splitting to maximize the score. I assume I'll iterate over the array and compute cumulative sums to make those decisions.

**Harper:** Exactly, cumulative sums could vastly reduce the time it takes to calculate the sum of any given sub-array, which is crucial for evaluating each potential split.

**Max:** Also, remember to consider the base cases like when there's only one stone left. The game ends, and no further score can be obtained.

**Jordan:** Got it. This is starting to make more sense. Implementing a dynamic programming solution that iteratively updates based on optimal splits and utilizes cumulative sums for efficient calculations seems like the way to go.

**Harper:** Don't hesitate to backtrack to previous decisions if you find a more optimal split as you progress. It's all about maximizing Alice's score by the end of the game.

**Jordan:** Thanks, Max and Harper. This has really helped clarify how I should approach solving this problem. I'm going to try coding this out now.

**Max:** Good luck! Feel free to bounce off more ideas if you get stuck again. Happy coding!

**Harper:** Yeah, solving these kinds of problems is always a bit tricky at first, but once you find the right approach, it all clicks together. Keep at it!
