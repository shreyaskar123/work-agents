**Alex**: Hey, Jordan. I ran into a bit of a tricky problem I thought you might help me with. It's about detecting cycles in a 2D grid of characters. Do you have a moment?

**Jordan**: Sure, Alex. Sounds interesting. Lay it on me.

**Alex**: So, we're given a 2D array `grid`, which is of size `m x n`. We need to find if there exists any cycle in the grid consisting of the same character. The cycle should be of length 4 or more, and you can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent cell if it has the same value.

**Jordan**: Got it. The cycle starts and ends at the same cell, right? And I assume we can't revisit the cell that we just visited?

**Alex**: Exactly, like if you go from cell `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`, you can't go back to `(1, 1)` immediately.

**Jordan**: That makes sense. So, how do you plan on tackling this? Depth-first search (DFS) seems like a solid approach here, considering we'd need to explore potential cycles from each cell while keeping track of the path.

**Alex**: Right, I was thinking along the same lines. But I'm unsure about the specifics, like how to keep track of the cells I've visited and how to make sure the path forms a cycle of length 4 or more.

**Jordan**: Well, for tracking, you could use a visited matrix that mirrors your grid's dimensions. As for ensuring the path is a cycle, you'd need to start your DFS from every cell, marking it visited. If during your exploration, you come back to the start cell and your path is at least 4 moves, that confirms a cycle.

**Alex**: That makes sense. So, basically, run a DFS from each cell that's not yet visited, and explore all four directions in each step. But, how do I avoid revisiting the immediately previous cell?

**Jordan**: You could pass the previous cell's coordinates along with your DFS recursive calls. That way, you can ensure your next move isn't to those coordinates.

**Alex**: I see. And I guess every time I move to a new cell, I should mark it as visited, right? But wait, wouldn't that prevent the cycle from closing since the starting cell would be marked as visited?

**Jordan**: Good point. You could temporarily mark cells as visited but unmark them if a particular path doesn't lead to a cycle. That or differentiate the start cell somehow in your condition checks.

**Alex**: Ah, I get it now. And I assume once I find a valid cycle, I can stop my search and return true. Otherwise, if I exhaust all cells without finding a cycle, I return false.

**Jordan**: Exactly. This approach should cover all bases for detecting a cycle in your grid.

**Alex**: This has been incredibly helpful, Jordan. I think I have a solid starting point now. I'll definitely reach out if I hit any roadblocks.

**Jordan**: Anytime, Alex. Happy coding, and let me know how it goes!
