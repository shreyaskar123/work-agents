**Alice**: Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining the brainstorm session today. We've been tasked with an interesting problem: finding all distinct non-empty substrings of a given text, which can be described as a concatenation of some string with itself. Any initial thoughts?

**Bob**: Interesting challenge. So, we’re looking for substrings that are essentially a repeated pattern of some sort, right? Like, “abc” repeated would give us “abcabc.”

**Charlie**: Exactly, Bob. Now, considering the examples provided, such as "abcabcabc" yielding three substrings, it seems like we’ll have to consider overlapping scenarios as well.

**Diana**: That’s a good point, Charlie. We also need to ensure uniqueness in our output, which means no duplicate substrings. This could complicate things a bit.

**Alice**: True. Let’s break down the problem logically. First, we might need a way to iterate through all possible substrings of the given text. Any ideas on how we could approach this?

**Bob**: We could use a double loop strategy. The outer loop can specify the starting point of the substring, and the inner loop can control the length of the substring.

**Charlie**: And don’t forget, once we have each substring, we need a mechanism to check if it can indeed be divided into two equal halves that are identical. Any efficient way to do that?

**Diana**: I think hashing might be a useful strategy here. If we hash each substring, comparing for equality between two halves becomes much easier and faster.

**Alice**: Great input, Diana. Now, considering we need only distinct substrings, how can we ensure that we're not including duplicates in our final count?

**Bob**: A simple approach would be to use a set data structure since that automatically handles uniqueness for us. We can hash the substrings, as suggested, and store those hash values in the set.

**Charlie**: Also, let’s not forget about the constraint where the text length can go up to 2000 characters. Our solution must be optimized enough to handle long strings within a reasonable time frame.

**Diana**: Definitely. Efficiency is key. We should also look into optimizing our substring generation process to avoid unnecessary computations.

**Alice**: All valid points, team. We have a basic strategy now: iterating through substrings, validating our conditions, ensuring uniqueness, and maintaining efficiency. Let's start prototyping based on this discussion, keeping scalability and performance in mind.

**Bob**: Sounds like a plan. Working on efficient hashing and avoiding duplicate processing will be critical.

**Charlie**: Agreed. I’ll start looking into optimizing the substring generation and checking process.

**Diana**: And I’ll focus on how we can use data structures effectively to keep track of our unique, valid substrings.

**Alice**: Perfect. Let’s regroup after a day and share our findings. Thanks, everyone, for the productive discussion. Looking forward to seeing what we come up with!
