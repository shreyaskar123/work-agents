**Alice**: Hey everyone, let’s dive into the problem we have on hand today. We need to maximize the number of cherries our two robots can collect from a grid, following a specific movement pattern.

**Bob**: Right, each robot starts from the top of the grid but at opposite sides. They can move down to the next row and choose to go left, right, or down directly.

**Charlie**: That's an interesting setup. So, it seems like a dynamic programming problem since we need to make decisions at each step that affect the final outcome.

**Diana**: Exactly. But there's a catch with two robots. Their paths might intersect, and we can only collect cherries from a cell once.

**Alice**: Correct. That means if both robots pass through the same cell, we only count the cherries once. We need to carefully track their paths.

**Bob**: So, for each cell, we should consider the robots' positions relative to each other. Positions where they collide would need special handling.

**Charlie**: I'm thinking we might need a 3D matrix for storing the maximum number of cherries we can collect at each step, taking into account both robots' positions.

**Diana**: That’s a good point. The third dimension could represent the possible configurations of the robots' positions relative to each other.

**Alice**: Absolutely, and we iterate through the grid row by row, calculating the maximum possible cherries for every cell, considering all possible moves the robots could have taken to get there.

**Bob**: This means we have to check all combinations of movements for both robots when transitioning from one row to the next.

**Charlie**: Yeah, but we also have to be careful not to move the robots outside the grid. That adds some boundary conditions to our calculations.

**Diana**: True. For example, if a robot is at the leftmost or rightmost column, it can’t move further left or right, respectively.

**Alice**: Given these constraints, our objective at each step is to choose the optimal move for both robots that maximizes the cherry collection, right?

**Bob**: Exactly. And since we’re looking for the maximum number of cherries collected when both robots reach the bottom row, our final answer would be in the last row of our matrix.

**Charlie**: Right, but we'll have to keep in mind that we're effectively summarizing paths here, so our algorithm needs to consider all possible paths to the bottom row for both robots.

**Diana**: Precisely. It seems like the complexity could be quite high given all the permutations of movements. Optimization and efficient memoization will be key in implementing this.

**Alice**: Definitely. Once we've calculated this 3D matrix, we can deduce the maximum number of cherries from the bottom row configurations. This should give us the solution to our problem.

**Bob**: Agreed. Let’s start sketching out the code and see how we can optimize as we go. Keeping track of state efficiently is going to be the challenging part.
