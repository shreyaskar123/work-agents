**Alex:** Hey everyone, glad to see you all could make it to this brainstorming session. So, we've got a pretty interesting problem to tackle today involving an array composed entirely of 0s and 1s. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of K-bit flips required to change all the 0s in the array to 1s. Any initial thoughts?

**Jordan:** It definitely sounds like a sliding window or maybe a greedy problem to me. But the catch with having to flip a subarray of length K makes it trickier. First off, do we have any constraints we need to consider?

**Alex:** Good point, Jordan. The array length can go up to 30,000, and K will be at least 1 and can go up to the length of the array. 

**Morgan:** That's quite a large range for the array size. A brute force approach might not be efficient here given the constraints. Are there particular patterns or examples we can dissect to help us understand better?

**Alex:** Sure, let's look at some examples. For an array `[0,1,0]` with K being `1`, the solution is 2 flips. Another example is `[1,1,0]` with K set to `2`; this one's interesting because no matter how we flip, we can't get all 1s, so the output is `-1`.

**Sasha:** Those examples help clear things up a bit. I'm thinking of maintaining a count of flips as we go along the array. But there's the challenge of effectively flipping and ensuring we don't end up in an infinite loop of flips.

**Jordan:** Yeah, Sasha, that's a good observation. It also sounds like we'll need to keep track of the flips somehow to know when to flip back if we've overlapped our operations. This might hint at using some form of a sliding window to keep track of the range being flipped.

**Morgan:** Right, and maybe we could use an additional data structure, like a queue or something, to help keep track of the flips' positions as we move along the array. This could help us in figuring out when a flip affects a subsequent subarray.

**Alex:** Exactly, Morgan. And consider the edge cases, like when the subarray to be flipped includes both 1s and 0s. How does that impact our strategy and the overall number of flips needed?

**Sasha:** It's crucial to ensure that we're not just counting flips but actually ensuring those flips result in a continuous array of 1s. This probably means we need to flip at the first occurrence of 0 we encounter as we traverse the array within the constraints of K.

**Jordan:** We'll also need a strategy for when it's not possible to flip all 0s to 1s, like in the `[1,1,0]` with `K=2` example. It's important our solution can identify and return `-1` in cases where a solution isn't feasible.

**Alex:** I think we're on a good track here. This discussion has laid a solid foundation for approaching the problem. Remember, we're not just coding the solution, but rather, thinking through the logic and ensuring our approach is efficient and covers all possible scenarios the problem can present.

**Morgan:** Agreed, I'll start drafting some pseudocode based on our discussion. We can iterate over that and refine our approach.

**Sasha:** And I'll look into optimizing our strategy, ensuring we're minimizing the number of flips and properly handling all edge cases.

**Jordan:** I'll focus on the feasibility checks, making sure we can quickly identify impossible scenarios to save time and resources.

**Alex:** Great team effort, everyone. Let's reconvene after a bit and bring all our parts together. This is a classic problem-solving scenario, and I'm confident we'll crack it.
