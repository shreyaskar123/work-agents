Alex: Hey, Jamie, did you get a look at that problem on counting ships within a specified rectangle on a cartesian plane?

Jamie: Yeah, I glanced over it. It's quite a challenge since you can't directly see the ships' locations. You have to use the `hasShips` function to figure out if there are any ships in a given rectangle. 

Alex: Exactly. The function returns true if there's at least one ship within the rectangle defined by its top-right and bottom-left corners. But we're limited to making no more than 400 calls to this function.

Jamie: Right, so brute-forcing through each possible point to see if there's a ship there won't work. We'd run out of API calls too quickly, especially considering the problem's constraints.

Alex: I was thinking, since we're working with rectangles, could we maybe use a divide-and-conquer approach? Splitting the search area into smaller rectangles and checking each one?

Jamie: That sounds promising. We could check the entire given rectangle first, and if there are no ships, we're done. If there is at least one, we split it into four equal parts and check each smaller rectangle.

Alex: But what about the base case for this recursion? How small do we go before we stop dividing further?

Jamie: Good point. Since each point can contain at most one ship, the smallest rectangle we need to check could be a single point, essentially when the top right and bottom left corners are the same.

Alex: Makes sense. Also, we'll need a way to keep track of our total ship count as we divide and conquer.

Jamie: Right, we could have a counter that accumulates the number of ships found in each recursive call. But, to avoid overcounting, we only increment our counter if the `hasShips` call over a rectangle returns true, and we've determined we're at the smallest possible rectangle size.

Alex: About dividing the search area, we'll need to be careful with how we determine the boundaries of the smaller rectangles to ensure we cover the entire area without overlap or gaps.

Jamie: Definitely. We could calculate midpoints for the x and y coordinates, and use those to define the new corners for the smaller rectangles.

Alex: This is shaping up to be a solid strategy. We'll just have to implement it carefully to handle all the edge cases and ensure we're not making unnecessary calls to `hasShips`.

Jamie: Agreed. Plus, we should keep an eye on the recursive depth and the total number of `hasShips` calls to avoid hitting the limit.

Alex: Alright, let's prototype this solution and run some tests. Thanks for the brainstorm, Jamie!

Jamie: Anytime, Alex! Let's get this figured out.
