**Sophia**: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. Today, we’re going to dissect a fascinating problem that revolves around counting digits in integers. Has everyone had a chance to look at the example regarding counting digit '1' in all non-negative integers less than or equal to a given integer?

**Elijah**: Morning! Yes, I did. It seems straightforward at first glance, but I suspect there's more under the hood. For instance, counting digit '1' for numbers up to 13 — it feels like a manual counting task. I’m curious about the efficient way to approach it.

**Mia**: Hi, everyone! Yes, looking at the example, manual counting obviously won’t scale for larger numbers. I assume there’s a mathematical or algorithmic trick to this that we’re missing. 

**Sophia**: Exactly, Mia. The brute force method can give us insight, but as Elijah pointed out, it's not practical for large `n` values. There’s indeed a pattern to how digits repeat, and understanding that is key to solving this efficiently.

**Elijah**: I suspect this could involve some form of iteration over the digit places and calculating occurrences in each place. But I'm not entirely sure how to structure this. Do we start from the least significant digit and move up?

**Mia**: That sounds like a plausible starting point, Elijah. Also, considering how frequently the digit '1' appears in different positions could be pivotal. Like, the difference in occurrence when '1' is in the tens places versus the ones place.

**Sophia**: You’re both on the right track. Thinking about the significance of each digit's place is essential. For a comprehensive solution, considering each digit's position from least to most significant could unravel the pattern.  How might the position of '1' influence the total count, depending on the size of `n`?

**Elijah**: Ah, I think I see where this is going. If you break down the number by place values, you can perhaps create a formula to calculate the frequency of '1' in each position based on the remainder of the number when divided by certain thresholds.

**Mia**: Right, and it’s not just about the current digit but also about the digits to the right and left of it. This sounds like it involves some clever mathematics regarding how numbers are structured and how digit repetition works across place values.

**Sophia**: Absolutely, Mia. Considering the contribution of digits to the left and right indeed forms the crux of a scalable solution. There’s a systematic way to analyze this, and it leads to a solution that avoids brute-forcing every possibility.

**Elijah**: This sounds like a lesson in both mathematics and algorithm optimization. I'm eager to draft some pseudocode to test our theories. Should we also consider edge cases, like the highest values `n` can take, to ensure our solution holds?

**Mia**: Good point, Elijah. Testing for edge cases ensures robustness. It's important to remember the constraint given, with `n` going up to `2 * 10^9`. Our solution needs to perform well within these bounds.

**Sophia**: Great observations, both of you. Developing an efficient algorithm for this problem does indeed test our ability to optimize and think mathematically. After this discussion, I recommend each of you to implement a solution that reflects our analysis. Remember, there’s elegance in simplicity, but correctness and efficiency are our paramount goals.

**Elijah**: Will do, Sophia. I’m looking forward to applying these concepts practically. It’s going to be an interesting challenge to encapsulate our discussion into code.

**Mia**: Same here! I can already tell that applying this discussion will be as enlightening as it is challenging. Can’t wait to dive in and see how our theoretical solution holds up in practice.

**Sophia**: Fantastic. Looking forward to our follow-up meeting to discuss our implementations. Great session today, everyone. Have a productive coding session!

**Elijah & Mia**: Thanks, Sophia! Looking forward to it. Goodbye!
