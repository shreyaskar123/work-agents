**Alex:** Hey, Jordan and Taylor, have you had a chance to look into the problem of making one array strictly increasing by replacing elements from another array?

**Jordan:** Yeah, I went through it. It seems like a dynamic optimization problem. It's not just about finding which elements to replace, but also in what order to make the `arr1` strictly increasing.

**Taylor:** Definitely, it's also crucial to note that we can't just replace an element in `arr1` with any element in `arr2`. We need to make sure that the new element maintains the strictly increasing order of `arr1`.

**Alex:** Right, so one of the first steps might involve sorting `arr2`, I guess?

**Jordan:** Exactly, sorting `arr2` makes it easier to find the smallest element greater than the current element in `arr1` that we want to replace. But, sorting alone won't solve the problem.

**Taylor:** And we have to consider what happens when there's no element in `arr2` that can replace the current element in `arr1` to maintain or achieve the strictly increasing sequence. 

**Alex:** That's a tricky part. I was thinking, maybe we have to use some form of dynamic programming or memoization to keep track of the minimum operations needed at each step.

**Jordan:** You're on the right track. It might help to maintain a structure that keeps track of the minimum number of operations needed to make the `arr1` strictly increasing up to each element. The challenge is in figuring out the state transitions.

**Taylor:** For state transitions, perhaps comparing the current `arr1` element with the possible elements in `arr2` that could replace it, and finding the one that requires the least number of operations while maintaining the order?

**Alex:** Sounds complex. Would we also need to consider cases where replacing an element isn't the best option and it's better to leave the element in `arr1` as is?

**Jordan:** Yes, and that adds another layer of complexity since we need to choose between replacing an element and keeping it, depending on which option keeps `arr1` strictly increasing with the fewest operations.

**Taylor:** It feels like this problem requires a good understanding of dynamic programming and some intelligent traversal of `arr1` and `arr2` to find the most efficient solution.

**Alex:** Agreed, it's not just about understanding the dynamic programming concept but also about how to effectively apply it to manage both arrays and all possible scenarios.

**Jordan:** Definitely. And, the edge case where it's not possible to make `arr1` strictly increasing should return `-1` as well.

**Taylor:** Yep, ensuring that we cover that scenario is crucial. Otherwise, someone might spend a lot of time trying to find a solution when thereâ€™s none.

**Alex:** Alright, it seems like we have a good conceptual understanding of how to approach this problem. We'll need to dive into the specifics of implementing this logic efficiently.

**Jordan:** I agree. Let's start by breaking down this problem into smaller tasks and tackling each with a clear strategy.

**Taylor:** Sounds like a plan. Once we lay down the logic, coding this should be straightforward, albeit with careful consideration of the edge cases and ensuring we're using dynamic programming effectively.

**Alex:** Perfect, let's get started on drafting some pseudo-code and think about how we can test our solution with edge cases.
