**Emily:** So, I was thinking about how we could approach the problem where we need to convert a string to the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Any ideas on where we should start?

**Jordan:** Ah, yes. It might help to first understand what a palindrome is—a string that reads the same backward as forward, right?

**Alex:** Exactly! And from what I gathered, the trick is finding the longest palindromic prefix because that’s the part that doesn’t need to be changed. The rest of the string needs to be mirrored in front to make the entire thing a palindrome.

**Emily:** That’s a solid point, Alex. So, essentially, we're trying to identify that part of the string which when mirrored and appended at the beginning makes the whole string a palindrome.

**Jordan:** Sounds like a plan, but how do we efficiently find this palindromic prefix? Going character by character seems inefficient.

**Alex:** Well, a popular string algorithm that might come in handy is the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm. It's usually used for pattern searching, but with a twist, we can use it to find the longest palindromic prefix.

**Emily:** Oh, interesting application! So, we're using KMP to preprocess the string in some way to help us identify the palindrome?

**Jordan:** Exactly, but instead of looking for a pattern in a text, we are kind of looking for the pattern within the string itself to identify that break point.

**Alex:** Right. And there's also the part where we need to prepare the string for KMP. We reverse the string and concatenate it with the original using a special character in between to avoid any overlap confusion.

**Emily:** That special character acts as a delimiter, then. This ensures that the pattern (the reversed string) doesn’t mix with the original string in the KMP processing stage.

**Jordan:** Once we have the preprocessing done, the KMP algorithm helps us find the longest prefix which is also a suffix. But in our transformed string, this effectively tells us how much of the beginning of the original string matches the end of it in palindrome fashion.

**Alex:** Exactly! And the beauty of it is that once we know how much of it is already a palindrome, we only need to append the reverse of the remaining part at the beginning to get our shortest palindrome.

**Emily:** That’s quite clever. So, if I understand correctly, after using KMP, the part of the string not included in the palindromic prefix needs to be reversed and added to the start.

**Jordan:** Yep, that's about it. It turns the problem into something we can solve efficiently, without brute-forcing our way through.

**Alex:** And regarding implementation, it sounds complex, but it’s really about understanding how KMP works and applying it to this specific context.

**Emily:** This has been a productive discussion. I think we’ve got a good grasp on the approach. We’ll need to carefully code this, especially the KMP preprocessing part, to avoid any off-by-one errors or issues with the delimiter.

**Jordan:** Good point, Emily. And let's not forget to run it through some test cases, especially edge cases like an empty string or a string that’s already a palindrome.

**Alex:** Definitely. Testing is crucial. Well, I think that’s a solid plan! I'll start drafting some pseudo-code based on our discussion.

**Emily:** Great! And let’s regroup once we have something working. It’ll be interesting to see this in action and ensure it meets the constraints, especially the string length.

**Jordan:** Absolutely, looking forward to it. Thanks for breaking it down, team.
