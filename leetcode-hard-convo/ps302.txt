**Alex:** So, this problem sounds like a classic dynamic programming challenge with a twist involving subsequences and a specific constraint on the indices of consecutive numbers in the chosen subsequence.

**Jordan:** Exactly, the constraint that the difference between the indices of any two consecutive numbers in the subsequence must be less than or equal to `k` adds an interesting layer. It means we can't just pick the largest numbers without considering their positions.

**Alex:** Right. A general approach for problems involving subsequences often starts with considering the choices at each step. In this case, for any element in the array, we decide whether to include it in our subsequence.

**Jordan:** So, for each element, we could look at the maximum sum we could achieve by including it, and that depends on the sums we've calculated for previous elements within the `k` range.

**Alex:** Precisely. It's like we're building up our solution by making the best choice at each step, considering the constraint. Given an element `nums[i]`, we need to consider elements from `i-k` to `i-1` to decide the best sum ending with `nums[i]`.

**Jordan:** That sounds like a classic use case for dynamic programming. We could have an array, let's call it `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at `nums[i]`, following our rules.

**Alex:** And to fill in `dp[i]`, we'd consider all valid `dp[j]` values where `j` ranges from `i-k` to `i-1`. The value of `dp[i]` would be the maximum of `nums[i]` itself (in case we start a new subsequence) or `nums[i] + dp[j]`, for all valid `j`s, to extend the previous subsequences to include `nums[i]`.

**Jordan:** Definitely, and after we've calculated all the `dp` values, the maximum sum of a valid subsequence would be the largest value in the `dp` array.

**Alex:** What about handling negative numbers in the array? Given the examples provided, it seems crucial to choose whether or not to start a new subsequence at a certain point, mainly to avoid including too many negative numbers.

**Jordan:** Good point. When calculating `dp[i]`, if `nums[i]` is larger than `nums[i] + dp[j]` for a certain `j`, it means starting a new subsequence with `nums[i]` is a better choice than extending any subsequence ending with `nums[j]`.

**Alex:** That makes sense. So, it's a matter of dynamically building up these choices while respecting our constraints. How about the performance? With the need to consider up to `k` previous elements for each `i`, it seems like the time complexity could be a concern.

**Jordan:** True. The basic approach might lead to a time complexity of O(n*k), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. For large values of `n` and `k`, it's not ideal. 

**Alex:** There might be ways to optimize it, perhaps by using some kind of data structure to keep track of the maximum `dp[j]` values in the range `[i-k, i-1]` more efficiently.

**Jordan:** Yeah, a sliding window approach or even a segment tree could be helpful for that, reducing the time needed to find the maximum sum in a range.

**Alex:** Right, this is a complex problem but thinking it through step by step, considering each element, and calculating the maximum sum up to that point with dynamic programming seems to be the way to go. Optimizing the process of finding the maximum in a range could significantly improve the solution.

**Jordan:** Definitely something worth exploring further. This sort of problem is what makes dynamic programming so interesting and challenging.
