Ella: Hey Jordan, thanks for meeting up. I've been racking my brain about this problem I came across. It's about finding the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one, but there's a catch with how many we can merge at once.

Jordan: Sounds interesting, Ella. So, how does this merging process work exactly?

Ella: Well, you can merge exactly `K` consecutive piles into one, and the cost of merging them is the total number of stones in those piles. The tricky part is doing it in a way that the total cost is minimized. 

Jordan: Got it. So, what kind of inputs are we talking about?

Ella: The problem gives us an array where each element represents the number of stones in a pile and an integer `K` that tells us how many piles we can merge in a single move. 

Chris: That reminds me of a dynamic programming problem. Finding the minimum cost seems like a problem where we'd have to consider multiple scenarios and choose the best one.

Ella: Exactly, Chris. And it seems there are scenarios where it might be impossible to merge all piles into one. Like, the example with `[3,2,4,1]` and `K = 3` essentially leaves us stuck after one merge.

Jordan: Makes sense. We'd need some way to check whether the merge is possible before even attempting to calculate the costs, right?

Ella: Right. The feasibility check seems crucial. Then, calculating the minimum cost if it is indeed possible. There are examples where different merges lead to different total costs, and finding the minimum among them is the goal.

Chris: Do you think a greedy approach would work here, just always merging the smallest `K` piles until there's only one left?

Ella: It's a good thought, Chris, but from the examples, it's not always about the smallest piles. It involves a bit more strategy, considering future merges and how they add up.

Jordan: Hmm, so it's about looking ahead and planning your moves. This sounds like it requires storing intermediate results and maybe revisiting them?

Ella: Yes, and considering how the costs add up over multiple merges. Thinking about it as a sequence of decisions where each impacts the next.

Chris: Sounds like we need some kind of memoization or a way to remember past decisions so we don't have to recalculate everything.

Jordan: Right, and perhaps breaking down the problem. Starting from the base case of merging `K` piles and expanding it to consider more piles as we look for the minimum cost.

Ella: I'm glad we're discussing this. Visualizing the problem as smaller subproblems definitely seems like the way to go. We also need to keep track of the total cost at each step.

Chris: Agreed. It's about finding the optimum path through all possible merge sequences, isn't it? 

Ella: Exactly, and ensuring we don't hit a scenario where a merge isn't possible while still aiming for the minimum cost.

Jordan: This feels like a puzzle, where each piece affects the final image. Planning and adjusting as we get more information.

Ella: Perfectly put. I think with this approach, breaking it down and carefully considering our options, we might just crack it. Let's get coding and see where we end up. Thanks for the brainstorm, everyone!

Chris: Anytime! Let's tackle this.
