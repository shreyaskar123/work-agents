**Ava**: Hey, Jamie, Chris, have you guys checked out that problem with the "n super washing machines"? It looks like a real brain teaser.

**Chris**: Oh, yes, I've seen that. It's all about distributing dresses evenly across the machines, right? But with a twist on how you can move them.

**Jamie**: Exactly, you can only move one dress at a time between adjacent machines. The whole goal is to figure out the minimum moves needed to even out the dresses, or determine it's impossible. Quite the optimization problem!

**Ava**: I was pondering over the example where you start with [1,0,5]. It's intriguing that it takes three moves to balance them out to [2,2,2].

**Chris**: Right, the process seems straightforward with that array. You're just moving dresses from the heavily loaded machine to its neighbors until everything is balanced.

**Jamie**: The tricky part is devising a general strategy that works for any given array, not just simple cases. 

**Ava**: I've been thinking about how to approach this. It seems like the first step is to determine if it's even possible to balance the dresses. There must be some kind of prerequisite condition related to the total dresses and the number of machines.

**Chris**: I think you're onto something. Like, if the total number of dresses isn't divisible by the number of machines, it's straight-up impossible, right?

**Jamie**: Exactly, that's a great starting point. And then, for how to actually distribute the dresses, we probably need to calculate the ideal number of dresses per machine and somehow measure how far off each machine is from this ideal state.

**Ava**: That sounds like a solid foundation. Calculating the ideal state and then figuring out the steps to achieve it... But how do we make it efficient? It can't be as simple as moving one dress at a time in the most obvious way.

**Chris**: Yeah, efficiency is key. There's got to be some pattern or method to minimize moves. Maybe something to do with choosing the optimal machines for each move, based on their current and ideal states?

**Jamie**: And we shouldn't forget about situations where it's impossible, like in the [0,2,0] scenario. Recognizing that early could save a lot of time in a real-world application.

**Ava**: Definitely. This problem not only tests algorithmic thinking but also optimization and edge case detection. We'll need to carefully consider each step and maybe even backtrack to find the most efficient path to the solution.

**Chris**: Sounds like we have a decent plan. Identify if a solution is possible, figure out the ideal state, and devise an efficient strategy to redistribute the dresses. Now, it's all about implementing it.

**Jamie**: Agreed! And remember, it's not always about finding the answer on the first try. Sometimes, iteratively refining your approach is necessary to devise an efficient solution.

**Ava**: Well then, let's sketch out some pseudo-code and start tackling this puzzle step by step. With a combination of logic and creativity, I'm sure we'll crack it. 

**Chris & Jamie**: Sounds like a plan! Let's do this.
