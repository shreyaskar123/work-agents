**Alex**: Hey everyone, thanks for joining this brainstorming session. We've been tasked with designing a class, `DinnerPlates`, that deals with stacks and their operations. Let's hash this out.

**Jordan**: Right, so starting with the `DinnerPlates` constructor, it's clear we need some way to initialize these stacks with a given `capacity`. Any thoughts on first steps?

**Morgan**: We could use a list of lists to represent the stacks. The outer list could represent the entire row of stacks, while the inner lists represent the individual stacks with their elements.

**Chris**: That makes sense. For the `push` operation, we need to find the leftmost stack with size less than `capacity` and add a new plate to it. I'm thinking we track the next available stack for pushing in some way to optimize this process.

**Jordan**: Great point, tracking the next available stack is crucial. We could maintain an index or use a more dynamic data structure that helps identify the next viable stack quickly.

**Alex**: Now, the tricky part might be the `pop` operation. We need to pick the plate from the top of the rightmost non-empty stack. Any ideas on how to efficiently track the rightmost non-empty stack?

**Morgan**: Similar to tracking the leftmost stack for pushing, we could keep an eye on the rightmost stack for popping. Maybe keep updating a variable that holds the index of that stack whenever we push or pop.

**Chris**: The `popAtStack` method is interesting. We directly pop from a stack at a specific index. This might impact which stack is considered rightmost non-empty or leftmost available, especially if we're popping from the middle somewhere.

**Jordan**: True, every operation affects the others. For `popAtStack`, besides removing the top element, we should update our tracking for leftmost and rightmost stacks as needed. It's also kinda neat how these operations interact and depend on each other's state.

**Alex**: Absolutely, and don't forget error handling, like returning `-1` if a pop operation is called on empty stacks or if `popAtStack` targets an empty stack. These edge cases are important for robustness.

**Morgan**: To sum up, we're implementing a dynamic structure that keeps track of stacks' states, optimizes for locating the next stack for pushing, and ensures efficient popping from both specific and the rightmost stacks. Plus, we need to handle cases where operations can't be completed as requested.

**Chris**: Sounds like we've got a solid plan. We'll need to code this out carefully, especially managing the state efficiently, so our class can handle a large number of calls without performance issues.

**Jordan**: Right, let's draft this up, focusing on clean, efficient code and thorough testing, especially for those edge cases we talked about. Thanks for the productive discussion, everyone!

**Alex**: Thanks, team. Let's regroup after the initial implementation for a review. Looking forward to seeing this come together.
