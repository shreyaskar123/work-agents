**Alice:** So, we've been tasked with determining if a frog can cross a river by jumping on stones without falling into the water. It sounds like we're dealing with an interesting dynamic programming problem, right?

**Ben:** Exactly, Alice. The key here lies in the constraints given, like the frog's ability to jump `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units based on its last jump. We should start by understanding how we can keep track of these jumps effectively.

**Alice:** That makes sense. Let's consider the example where the stones are positioned at `[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]`. The frog starts on the first stone, and its first jump has to be 1 unit. This means we're not just keeping track of the stones but also how far the frog can potentially jump from each stone, don't you think?

**Ben:** Right. It's like we need a way to map out all possible jumps the frog can make from each stone and see if there's a pathway that leads to the final stone. Do you think using recursion to test each possibility would work?

**Charlie:** I was listening in, and recursion might work, but it could also lead to a lot of repeated calculations, especially with a large number of stones. Maybe we should think about optimizing it with memoization or even tabulation?

**Alice:** Good point, Charlie. Memoization could help us avoid recalculating for stones we've already considered. But, we also need to make sure we're not just checking if we can reach each stone, but that we can do so with a valid jump from the previous stone(s).

**Ben:** And don't forget, the problem statement implies the solution doesn't just require reaching the last stone, but doing so following the `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` rule. We might need a structure to store the last jump's length that got us to each stone.

**Charlie:** I wonder if we can use a set or a dictionary for each stone to keep track of all the possible jump lengths that can reach that stone. That way, for each stone, we can quickly check if a jump from it is viable based on our previous jumps.

**Alice:** That's a solid approach. So, for each stone, we iterate through the possible jumps based on the previous stone's jump lengths and see if we can reach another stone. If we can, we update the possible jump lengths for that stone.

**Ben:** It sounds like a plan. We just need to ensure we're checking if we can reach the last stone in our data structure. If there's at least one way to reach it, based on our rules, we return `true`.

**Charlie:** Let's also not forget about the edge cases, such as when the stones are too far apart for even the maximum possible jump. We need to integrate checks for those scenarios as well.

**Alice:** Absolutely. We should draft a flowchart or pseudo-code to outline these steps more clearly. Mapping out our approach will make coding it much more straightforward.

**Ben:** Agreed. Once we have the algorithm outlined, we can discuss which programming language would be best suited for implementing it. Efficiency might be key here.

**Charlie:** Perfect. Let's start drafting then. It'll be interesting to see this solution come to life, considering all the dynamics involved with the frog's potential jumps.
