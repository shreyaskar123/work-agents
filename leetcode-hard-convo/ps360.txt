**Ava**: Hey folks, we've got a tricky problem on our hands for today's brainstorming session. We need to figure out how to optimally distribute an integer array into `k` subsets of equal size, with no two equal elements in the same subset. The goal is to minimize the sum of each subset's incompatibility.

**Ben**: Interesting challenge. So, to clarify on incompatibility - it's the difference between the max and min elements in a subset, right?

**Ava**: Exactly, Ben. For example, if you have a subset [1,4], its incompatibility is 3, since 4 - 1 = 3.

**Charlie**: Seems like the first step is to confirm it's actually possible to distribute the array as asked. The array’s length being divisible by `k` is one thing, but we also need to ensure no subset is forced to have duplicate elements.

**Ava**: Good point, Charlie. So, we need a quick way to check for that feasibility before even diving into distribution strategies.

**Ben**: Right. Let's consider some edge cases. Say, if the number of any particular element in the array is greater than `k`, that would immediately make our task impossible, wouldn't it?

**Ava**: Spot on. That's a quick preliminary check we can do.

**Charlie**: Assuming our array passes that check, how do we approach the distribution? It's not just about splitting the array; it’s about minimizing the incompatibility sum.

**Ava**: Well, one straightforward approach could be brute force - trying every possible combination. But given the potential array size, that could quickly become unfeasible. We need something smarter.

**Ben**: How about we sort the array first? That way, we can ensure that when we're distributing the elements, we're always working with elements as close to each other as possible, at least initially.

**Charlie**: Sorting does simplify our decision-making. Then maybe we could use some form of dynamic programming or backtracking to systematically explore possible distributions?

**Ava**: I like the dynamic programming angle. Especially because it feels like a problem where we're trying to minimize a cost, i.e., the sum of incompatibilities, and we could use previous solutions to build up to an optimal one.

**Ben**: And with backtracking, we can course-correct if we head down a path that doesn't seem to lead to an optimal distribution.

**Charlie**: That's a good combo then. Could we also use some form of memoization to remember past distributions that didn’t work out, so we don’t repeat those mistakes?

**Ava**: Definitely, Charlie. Memoization would help cut down the number of distributions we need to consider by remembering those that led to dead ends or suboptimal incompatibility sums.

**Ben**: This feels like a solid approach. Though I'm guessing implementing it would require careful consideration, especially in how we structure our dynamic programming table and the states we need to keep track of.

**Charlie**: Absolutely. And we'd need to frame our recursion or iterative logic to correctly navigate through all possible subsets, ensuring each element's allocation respects our initial constraints about duplicates.

**Ava**: Great discussion, folks. Let's get to work on drafting up some pseudocode based on these ideas. We'll tackle feasibility checks first, then sorting, and finally distribution using dynamic programming with a hint of backtracking and memoization.

**Ben**: Sounds like a plan. Time to get our hands dirty with some coding.
