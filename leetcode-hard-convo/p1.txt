**Alex:** Hey Jordan, have you started looking at that Regular Expression Matching problem? It seems pretty tough.

**Jordan:** Yeah, I've been looking into it. It's definitely one of those problems that test your understanding of recursion and dynamic programming.

**Alex:** Dynamic programming, huh? How does that come into play with regular expressions?

**Jordan:** Well, the key idea is to break down the problem into smaller problems. For example, if we can figure out how to match parts of the string and pattern, we can use those results to solve the larger problem.

**Alex:** Makes sense. So, what's the deal with the '.' and '*' characters?

**Jordan:** The '.' character is actually the simpler of the two. It can match any single character. So, if the pattern has a '.', it's like saying, "This can be any character."

**Alex:** Got it. And the '*'?

**Jordan:** '*' is where it gets interesting. It means that the character before it can appear zero or more times. So, for instance, 'a*' can match 'aaaa' or even be empty.

**Alex:** Okay, I think I understand. How would you approach the problem, though?

**Jordan:** One approach is to start with the base cases, like what happens when the string or the pattern is empty. Then, you have to consider each character in the string and the pattern, dealing with '.' and '*' appropriately.

**Alex:** I'm curious about the '*' cases. How do you handle that, especially with the "zero or more" part?

**Jordan:** It's tricky. You essentially have two options: either you use the character before '*' in the match, or you don't. If you use it, you have to check if the rest of the string matches the pattern starting from that character. If you don't use it, you move past the '*' in the pattern and check if the string matches the rest of the pattern.

**Alex:** That sounds like it could lead to a lot of recursion.

**Jordan:** Exactly, and that's where dynamic programming can help. You can cache the results of subproblems so you don't have to solve them over and over again.

**Alex:** Ah, so you avoid recalculating the same thing. Smart. I guess figuring out how to structure the cache and identifying the subproblems is key.

**Jordan:** Definitely. The structure of the cache and how you use it to store results is crucial. It can significantly reduce the time complexity.

**Alex:** Thanks, Jordan. This gives me a much clearer idea of where to start. I'll try sketching out some code and see where I get stuck.

**Jordan:** No problem, Alex. Feel free to bounce ideas off me. It's a challenging problem, but I'm sure you'll get it with some persistence.
