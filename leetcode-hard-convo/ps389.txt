**Alice**: Hey everyone, thanks for jumping on this meeting. I stumbled upon an interesting problem regarding prime factors and maximizing the number of nice divisors of a number. Couldn't wrap my head around it fully, thought maybe you guys could help out?

**Bob**: Sure thing, Alice. Could you elaborate a bit more on what exactly we're trying to accomplish?

**Alice**: Definitely. We're given a positive integer, let's call it `primeFactors`. Our goal is to construct another positive integer, let's name it `n`, that follows these conditions: The number of prime factors of `n` is at most `primeFactors`, and we need to maximize the number of nice divisors of `n`.

**Cara**: Wait, could you clarify what you mean by nice divisors?

**Alice**: Oh, a divisor of `n` is considered nice if it's divisible by every prime factor of `n`. For instance, if `n` equals 12, its prime factors would be `[2,2,3]`, making `6` and `12` its nice divisors, since they're divisible by both 2 and 3.

**Bob**: I see. And by prime factors, you mean...

**Alice**: The prime factors of a number `n` are just a list of prime numbers that multiply to give `n`. Remember, a prime number is greater than 1 and cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

**Cara**: So, if I get this right, we're somehow using these prime factors to figure out a scenario where `n` has the highest possible number of nice divisors, right? But there's a constraint on how many prime factors `n` can have.

**Alice**: Exactly, Cara. And here's a twist: the final answer, the number of nice divisors of `n`, can be quite large, so we're asked to return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Bob**: Hmm, this feels like it ties into some deeper mathematical principles or formulas we could use to simplify the process, especially considering the constraint on the number of nice divisors.

**Cara**: Are there any example inputs and outputs? That might help us visualize the problem and its solution better.

**Alice**: Sure, for example, if `primeFactors` is 5, the output is 6. A valid `n` here could be 200, which has 5 prime factors `[2,2,2,5,5]`, and it has 6 nice divisors `[10,20,40,50,100,200]`. There's no other value of `n` that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors than this.

**Bob**: Interesting. And how about for `primeFactors` above 5? Any example?

**Alice**: Yes, another one I found was if `primeFactors` is 8, the output should be 18.

**Cara**: This gives us some insight. We need to find a pattern or strategy that leverages these prime factors optimally. Maybe breaking down the problem, looking at prime factorization, the concept of nice divisors, and applying some modular arithmetic for the large numbers involved.

**Bob**: Agreed. Could it also be beneficial to consider how the distribution of prime factors affects the number of nice divisors? Like, is there a more efficient distribution of a given number of prime factors that maximizes the nice divisors?

**Alice**: That's exactly the kind of thinking we need. Balancing between the limitation on the number of prime factors and maximizing those nice divisors.

**Cara**: Alright, seems like we need to dig deeper into some mathematical concepts and maybe run through a few more examples to understand the underlying patterns.

**Bob**: Let's all take some time to research and reconvene. I think with a bit of exploration and maybe some coding, we might crack this.

**Alice**: Sounds like a plan. Thanks, everyone, for brainstorming. Let's circle back soon with any breakthroughs or new insights.

**Cara**: Looking forward to it. Catch you all later!
