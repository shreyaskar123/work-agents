**Ella**: Hey, Jamie. Have you seen this problem about creating a sorted array from a given integer array and calculating the total cost based on specific insertion rules?

**Jamie**: Oh, you're talking about the one where the cost depends on elements lesser or greater than the one being inserted, right?

**Ella**: Exactly! I'm trying to figure out the most efficient way to handle it, especially considering the constraints. It seems like a direct approach would be too slow.

**Sam**: Didn't that problem sound a lot like it's hinting at some form of binary search tree or segment tree to keep track of the elements as you insert them?

**Jamie**: Right. A straightforward approach using a linear data structure like an array would result in a time complexity that's not manageable for large inputs. Something that can provide us with the count of elements less than or greater than a given number efficiently is necessary.

**Ella**: So we are leaning towards a tree structure. How would we account for duplicate elements, though, given that it might skew the lesser/greater count?

**Sam**: For duplicates, we can modify our tree node to additionally keep a count of how many times the same element has been inserted. This way, we don't really skew our less-than or more-than calculation.

**Jamie**: Makes sense. Now, the key part is calculating the total cost. We need to iterate over each element in the `instructions` array, insert it into our tree, and calculate the cost based on the current state of the tree.

**Ella**: This iteration sounds like it's straightforward but thoughtful consideration of how to efficiently calculate the number of elements less or greater is vital here.

**Sam**: Exactly, each insertion needs to update the state of our tree so that subsequent searches/insertions can leverage the updated state for accurate calculations.

**Jamie**: We should also not forget about the modulo part. It's easy to overlook it and end up with an overflow issue for the total cost.

**Ella**: True. Every time we add the cost for an insertion, we'd wrap it with a modulo operation of `10^9 + 7`. It's a common trick to avoid overflow in such problems.

**Sam**: And since we are talking about efficiency, we should look out for the time complexity of our operations. Ideally, insertion and searching should be logarithmic if we're going down the tree route.

**Jamie**: Right. Keeping our tree balanced would be crucial then. An unbalanced tree could degrade our operations to linear time, which would defeat the purpose.

**Ella**: Looks like we've got a solid plan. We understand the problem, we've identified an efficient data structure, and we're aware of the operations we need to perform. Now it's all about implementing it carefully.

**Sam**: I can't wait to code this out. I'll start with defining the tree structure and then move on to the insertion and cost-calculation logic.

**Jamie**: Sounds good. Meanwhile, Ella and I can work on understanding how exactly the insertion logic would work in tandem with calculating the lesser/greater elements efficiently.

**Ella**: Agreed. Let's regroup after we have our initial versions and see if we can further optimize or if there are any edge cases we missed.

**Jamie & Sam**: Sounds like a plan!
