**Jamie**: Hey Alex, did you get a chance to look into that search autocomplete system we discussed?

**Alex**: Yeah, I've been thinking it through. The main challenge seems to be efficiently finding the top 3 hot sentences that match the prefix as the user types, right?

**Jamie**: Exactly. And we need to consider the historical data of sentences and their frequencies. Did you come up with any data structure to handle that?

**Alex**: My initial thought is to use a Trie data structure. Each node could represent a character, and we can store the frequency of each sentence at the end nodes.

**Morgan**: Interesting, but how would you handle the sorting based on frequency and ASCII code order for sentences with the same frequency?

**Alex**: I was thinking about using a priority queue at each Trie node. This way, we can keep the sentences sorted based on their hotness degree and ASCII order efficiently.

**Jamie**: That makes sense. But wouldn't maintaining a priority queue at each node make the system memory-intensive?

**Alex**: True, it's a trade-off. But considering our constraints, it should be manageable. Also, updating the frequency as the user types and committing a new sentence when they end with '#' is a key part of the operation.

**Morgan**: Right, about updating frequencies, how are you planning to keep track of the sentences as the user types? Especially handling the new sentences.

**Alex**: I was thinking each end node in the Trie could have a reference to its corresponding sentence in a global hash map. This way, we can efficiently update frequencies or add new sentences.

**Jamie**: And for the input function, how do you plan on tracking the user's current input to suggest the top 3 hot sentences dynamically?

**Alex**: I'm considering maintaining a StringBuilder to keep track of the current input prefix. For each character input, we can traverse the Trie to the corresponding node and suggest the top sentences from the priority queue.

**Morgan**: What about when the user types '#'?

**Alex**: When '#' is typed, it signals the end of an input. We’ll add or update the sentence in our historical data, reset the StringBuilder, and ensure the Trie gets updated accordingly.

**Jamie**: Sounds like a solid plan. Have you considered the performance implications, especially for very frequent updates?

**Alex**: Yes, the performance mainly depends on the Trie traversal and the priority queue operations. Given our constraints, it should be efficient. The autocomplete suggestions should be fast since we're essentially traversing down the Trie and fetching from a sorted list.

**Morgan**: And resetting for each new input session with '#' could help manage memory by reusing components without needing too much cleanup, right?

**Alex**: Exactly, Morgan. Plus, resetting helps in starting each new input session cleanly, avoiding any carry-over data.

**Jamie**: Great discussion, folks. Let’s prototype this approach and run some tests with different datasets to measure performance and accuracy. I believe we’re on the right track.

**Alex**: Agreed. I’ll start working on implementing the Trie and priority queue logic. Let’s regroup once we have some initial results.

**Morgan**: Looking forward to it. This is going to be an interesting challenge to solve!
