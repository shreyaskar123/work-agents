Alex: So, we're tackling this interesting problem where we need to find how many non-negative integers `x` have `f(x) = K`, with `f(x)` being the number of zeroes at the end of `x!`. How do you all think we should approach this?

Jordan: Right, let’s first understand the problem by breaking down where these trailing zeroes come from. They're actually a result of multiplying factors of 5 and 2, which together make a 10, hence a trailing zero.

Morgan: True, but since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, we should really be focusing on how many times a factor of 5 will be present in `x!`.

Alex: That's a great point. To simplify, we can say the number of zeroes at the end of `x!` would be determined by the number of times we can divide `x!` by 5, right?

Jordan: Exactly, but it's a bit more nuanced because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5 to the factorization, but multiples of 25 contribute two, multiples of 125 contribute three, and so on. We must account for all of these.

Morgan: So, if we had to generalize this, for a given `x`, we should repeatedly divide by 5 and sum up all these results to find the total number of zeroes?

Alex: Right. Now, regarding finding `x` for a given `K`, it sounds like we would need to reverse-engineer this process. We know `K` represents the number of zeroes, which stems from factors of 5. We need to find out how many `x`'s factorials give us that `K`.

Jordan: It seems like a binary search could work well for this problem. Since the function of the number of trailing zeroes increases with `x`, and we’re looking for a specific value of `K`, a binary search might help us narrow down the potential values of `x` efficiently.

Morgan: Yeah, we could set up a range to search in. We know that no `x` below `K` can result in `K` trailing zeroes because at best, every 5th number contributes one more zero. So, the range could potentially start from `K` and go up to a point where it's impossible for more zeroes to be added within the bounds of the problem.

Alex: That makes a lot of sense. We'd be iterating over potential values of `x`, calculating how many trailing zeroes `x!` has, and comparing that to `K`. Our goal is to find all `x` that match this condition.

Jordan: But remember, the problem also asks for how many such `x` exist, not just what those values are. Once we find the range where `f(x) = K`, we need to count how many integers within that range satisfy our condition.

Morgan: Right, we'll need to carefully handle the edges of our search range to ensure we're counting all valid `x`'s accurately, considering the contribution of higher powers of 5.

Alex: It seems like we’ve outlined a decent plan here. We understand the relationship between the factors of 5 in `x!` and the trailing zeroes, and we have a strategy utilizing binary search to find the `x`'s satisfying `f(x) = K`.

Jordan: I think the next step would be to start coding this solution, keeping in mind all the nuances we discussed, especially how to accurately count for every 5th, 25th, 125th, and so on.

Morgan: Exactly, let’s start implementing this approach and test it with various values of `K` to ensure our logic holds up.
