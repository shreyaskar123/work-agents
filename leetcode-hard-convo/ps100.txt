Jessica: Hey, Alex and Sam, thanks for joining the brainstorming session today. I've been grappling with this problem for a while. It’s kind of like the Zuma Game. Have you guys heard of it?

Alex: Oh, yeah! That's the one where you have a row of colored balls, right? And you try to eliminate all the balls by inserting additional ones to form a group of three or more of the same color?

Jessica: Exactly! The twist here is figuring out the minimal number of balls you need to insert to remove all the balls on the table. It's tricky because you can only use the balls you have in hand, which are of specific colors.

Sam: That sounds challenging. So, I guess we have to consider both the sequence of the balls on the table and the colors available in our hand. How do you even approach this?

Jessica: That's the part I'm stuck on. I was thinking of starting with identifying patterns or groups in the initial sequence — like where inserting a ball would have the most impact.

Alex: Makes sense. Maybe looking for potential spots where adding a ball would create a chain reaction, removing multiple groups of balls at a time.

Sam: I'm also thinking depth-first search might be useful here. Like, recursively trying out every possible insertion and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed.

Jessica: Yeah, I was leaning towards that too. I think we'd also need to take into account the state of the board and what balls we have left in our hand at every step.

Alex: Right, so it's not just about making a move, but the optimal sequence of moves. This problem probably requires backtracking as well, to explore different scenarios.

Sam: Absolutely. And about keeping track of the balls, maybe we could use a hashmap or something to keep count of the colors in our hand. That way, we can efficiently check if we can make a certain move.

Jessica: Good idea, Sam. We'd also have to handle the case where it's impossible to clear the board with the balls in hand. Like, knowing when to output -1 if the situation looks unwinnable based on the remaining balls.

Alex: Oh, it’s going to be essential to handle that gracefully, especially since the problem statement mentions that scenario specifically.

Sam: Do you think concatenation plays a big role here? Like after every removal, the row changes and potentially creates new opportunities for removal.

Jessica: Definitely, Sam. The dynamic nature of the board means we have to reevaluate after every move. It's like a puzzle where the pieces keep changing shape.

Alex: Sounds like we've got a solid starting point then. Identifying key moves, exploring every possibility with a depth-first approach, and managing our resources wisely.

Jessica: Exactly. Let's draft this out and start with some pseudocode. I think breaking down the problem into smaller functions might help manage the complexity.

Sam: Agreed. And let's not forget to test out edge cases, like minimal board lengths or having more than enough balls in hand.

Alex: This was a great brainstorming session. Thanks, Jessica and Sam. I feel like we’re getting closer to cracking this.

Jessica: Definitely. Thanks for the insights, everyone. Let’s regroup after some solo brainstorming and see where we stand.
