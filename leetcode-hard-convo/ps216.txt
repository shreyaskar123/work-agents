**Elena**: Hey everyone, glad we could meet. I was pondering over how to approach a problem. Essentially, we're given an array of non-negative integers, and we need to determine the number of permutations of the array that are squareful. A squareful array means every pair of adjacent elements' sum is a perfect square.

**Alex**: Interesting! So, for each permutation of the array, we need to check if it satisfies the squarefulness condition, right?

**Jordan**: Precisely. But checking every permutation would be inefficient, given the array size could be up to 12 elements. That's a lot of permutations.

**Elena**: True. We need a smarter approach. Perhaps we could start by mapping out which numbers can come next to each other based on the squareful condition.

**Marie**: Sounds like a plan. We could create a graph where each number in the array represents a node, and edges connect nodes that can be adjacent based on the squareful criteria.

**Alex**: Then, we'd essentially be looking for all possible paths through this graph that use each node exactly once. Isn't that similar to the Hamiltonian path problem?

**Jordan**: It is, but with a twist. Since the numbers can repeat, we can have multiple edges between the same nodes or self-loops in case a number plus itself equals a perfect square.

**Elena**: Right, so we need to factor in the frequency of each number. We could use backtracking, visiting each node and keeping track of the count remaining for each number.

**Marie**: And at each step of the backtracking, we only consider nodes that are connected to the current one, ensuring the squarefulness of the permutation.

**Alex**: That makes sense. We also need a method to check if a sum is a perfect square. Any suggestions?

**Jordan**: Simple. After getting the sum, we find its square root and check if the squared value of the square root equals the original sum.

**Elena**: Perfect. We also need a base case for our backtracking, which could be when we've included all numbers from the array in our path.

**Marie**: I think we've got a solid plan. We construct the graph, use backtracking to explore squareful paths, and make sure to respect the frequency of each number.

**Alex**: And don't forget to avoid duplicate paths. Since the same number can appear multiple times, we might find the same permutation more than once.

**Jordan**: Good point, Alex. We'll need to take that into account to ensure our count is accurate.

**Elena**: Awesome. This was really productive. Let's start implementing this and see how it goes. Thanks, everyone!
