Alex: Hey Jordan, thanks for coming in. Did you see that LeetCode might be going for an IPO soon?

Jordan: Yeah, I heard about that. Sounds like they're trying to boost their capital by picking the right projects to work on before they go public.

Alex: Exactly. They've got a bit of a situation, though. They can only take on a limited number of projects because of their resources. Say, only k projects before the IPO.

Jordan: Makes sense. They'd want to maximize their capital, right? So, what's the strategy to pick these projects?

Alex: That's the million-dollar question. They start with an initial capital W. Each project has a potential profit and requires a minimum capital to get started. The goal is to choose at most k projects that maximize their final capital.

Jordan: OK, so it's not just about picking the projects with the highest profits then. They also need to consider the capital required to start a project.

Alex: Precisely. Let's look at an example to make it clearer. Imagine LeetCode has an initial capital of 0 and can pick up to 2 projects. The possible projects have profits of 1, 2, and 3, with respective capitals required being 0, 1, and 1.

Jordan: With an initial capital of 0, their only option to start would be the project with no capital requirement.

Alex: Yes, and completing that project increases their capital, allowing them to take on new projects that were previously out of reach.

Jordan: So, in this example, after completing the first project, they should go for the one with a profit of 3, giving them a total capital of 4.

Alex: Exactly, that's the kind of strategy we need to help LeetCode devise. But with potentially thousands of projects, manually picking isn't viable. They need an efficient way to determine which projects to choose.

Jordan: I'm thinking this requires some sort of prioritization of projects, maybe based on the profit they can generate relative to the capital required.

Alex: Agreed. Maybe something like creating a priority queue for projects could work, where projects are ordered based on certain criteria that align with LeetCode's IPO goals.

Jordan: Do you think sorting the projects by required capital and then by profit could help simplify choosing the right projects?

Alex: It could be a part of the strategy. They'd need to look at projects within their current capital reach and pick the ones with the best return on investment, so to speak.

Jordan: Sounds like they also need a way to adjust their strategy as their capital increases with each project.

Alex: For sure. This needs to be a dynamic process, possibly reassessing which projects become viable as their capital grows.

Jordan: This sounds like a fascinating problem. I'm guessing implementing the right algorithm is key to maximize their final capital.

Alex: Absolutely. It's not just about the algorithm, but also how they implement it to stay efficient with possibly tens of thousands of projects to consider.

Jordan: Well, I'm intrigued. I think with the right approach, LeetCode could significantly boost their IPO prospects.

Alex: Definitely. It's all about making smart choices with the resources they have. Thanks for brainstorming this with me, Jordan. Let's see if we can draft some pseudo-algorithm to outline our strategy.

Jordan: Sounds like a plan, Alex. Let's get to it.
