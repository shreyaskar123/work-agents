**Alex:** Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining today's brainstorming session. We've got an interesting challenge to tackle on algorithms. Specifically, we're looking at finding the k-th smallest integer within a range, ordered lexicographically.

**Jordan:** Interesting! So, if I'm hearing this right, we're essentially trying to sort numbers as if they were words, right? And from that, we find which one ranks at position `k`?

**Alex:** Exactly, Jordan. Let's use a simple example to grasp the concept. Suppose we have `n` equals 13, and we're looking for the k-th smallest number where `k` equals 2.

**Sam:** So, we'd first list out numbers from 1 to 13, then sort them lexicographically. I'm guessing this would change their original numerical order.

**Alex:** Spot on, Sam. And in this new order, we'd look for the second item on the list to solve our example.

**Jordan:** But doesn't that approach sound quite brute force? I mean, for smaller `n`, it's manageable, but if `n` approached it's upper limit, wouldn't that be computationally intensive?

**Alex:** Great point, Jordan. That's precisely why we're meeting today. We need a more efficient strategy than simply listing and sorting huge arrays. Any thoughts?

**Sam:** Maybe we can consider the problem from a tree perspective? If we think about it, each digit can lead to a branch of subsequent numbers. Like, starting with '1', we can go to '10', '11', etc., before moving to '2'.

**Jordan:** Ah, treating each digit as a path in a tree does sound promising! That way, we could potentially navigate through the 'tree' until we find our k-th element without explicitly sorting the entire set.

**Alex:** Right, the trick would be to determine how many elements are under each 'branch' or starting digit to navigate correctly. If we can calculate that efficiently, we might be onto a fast solution.

**Sam:** And considering the constraints, we'll need to also think about how we can do this calculation without causing any overflow or running into performance hiccups.

**Jordan:** Definitely. It's like piecing together a puzzle. We need to figure out the pattern in the branchesâ€”how the counts grow as we move from one digit to the next and down through levels.

**Alex:** Indeed. Today's session was about understanding the depth of the problem and brainstorming possible angles. I propose we take some time individually to think about this 'tree' and 'branching' concept, trying to flesh out a pseudo-code for efficiently navigating our way to the k-th smallest integer, lexicographically.

**Sam:** Sounds like a plan. This challenge has definitely piqued my curiosity. 

**Jordan:** Agreed. Plus, there's a certain satisfaction in finding an elegant solution to such a mathematically beautiful problem.

**Alex:** Perfect, then it's settled. Let's reconvene with our findings. Great discussion, everyone!
