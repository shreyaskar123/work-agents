**Alex:** Hi, Jamie and Casey. Thanks for joining today’s mini brainstorming session. I wanted to discuss an interesting problem I came across related to coordinate transformation. Have either of you heard of transforming a point `(x, y)` to either `(x, x+y)` or `(x+y, y)`?

**Jamie:** Oh, I think I have a vague idea about it. Are you referring to something like moving from a starting point `(sx, sy)` to a target point `(tx, ty)` using those transformations?

**Alex:** Exactly, Jamie. The challenge is to figure out if there’s a sequence of moves that allows us to transform `(sx, sy)` into `(tx, ty)`. It's sort of a puzzle that got me scratching my head.

**Casey:** Sounds like a logic problem. Do we have any constraints or specific examples to work with?

**Alex:** Yeah, all values for `sx, sy, tx, ty` are integers within the range of `[1, 10^9]`. To give you an example, if our starting point is `(1, 1)`, and we want to reach `(3, 5)`, we're trying to find if a sequence exists. In this case, it does, involving a few steps, transforming through intermediate points.

**Jamie:** So, the idea is to iteratively apply those transformations and see if we can land on the target coordinates, right? But I guess doing it straightforwardly could be a bit too brute force, especially considering the range of these numbers.

**Casey:** Hmm, brute force does sound impractical with those constraints. What about thinking in reverse? Like, starting from the target point and working our way back to the starting point?

**Alex:** That's a creative approach, Casey! By reversing the process, we might find a pattern or a condition that simplifies the problem, effectively reducing the complexity.

**Jamie:** And about sample questions, should we also consider edge cases, like when `sx` equals `tx` and `sy` equals `ty`? I'm assuming in those cases, the function should return `True` because we are already at the target.

**Casey:** Right, Jamie. Those are the base cases we definitely need to cover. Other scenarios could involve minimal moves or finding no possible sequence of moves to reach the target, which should return `False`.

**Alex:** Exactly! You both are on the right track. Considering a variety of scenarios will help us ensure any solution is robust and accounts for all possible inputs within the given constraints. How about we also discuss potential overflow issues or optimization techniques that could help with large values?

**Jamie:** Good point. We should definitely consider the efficiency of our approach, especially because of the large input range. Maybe we can look into some mathematical properties or shortcuts that could reduce the number of steps or operations needed.

**Casey:** Agreed. And regarding implementation, we need to remember to maintain readability and perhaps add comments explaining the logic behind our decisions, especially for the more complex steps or optimizations.

**Alex:** Great input, everyone! Let's start sketching out some pseudo-code based on our reverse thinking strategy. We can tackle each sample case, ensuring we handle edge cases and optimizations as we go. Thanks for the productive discussion!

**Jamie:** Sounds like a plan. Looking forward to seeing this problem unravel as we dive deeper into the logic.

**Casey:** Absolutely. It’s going to be an interesting challenge, especially applying our theoretical solution to actual code. Let's get to it!
