**Elena**: Alright team, we've got a complex problem to solve. It's about optimizing scores from pairs in an array through their greatest common divisor multiplied by the operation's index. Any initial thoughts?

**Miguel**: Interesting! So, it seems like finding pairs with the highest GCD early in the operation sequence could maximize our score.

**Tina**: Exactly, since the score is the product of the operation's index and the GCD of the chosen pair, early maximization is crucial. However, it's not just about the highest GCD, but also about choosing pairs that leave us in a good position for future operations.

**Alex**: Do you suggest we should consider all possible pairings then decide based on the overall potential score?

**Elena**: That could mean a lot of combinations given that the array size is 2 * n. For a small n, brute force could work, but we need a more efficient solution.

**Miguel**: What about a dynamic programming approach? Maybe we can break it down into smaller problems somehow?

**Tina**: That sounds promising. We could try to represent the problem as a state, such as the remaining elements and steps, and use recursion with memoization to avoid recalculating.

**Alex**: But there's also a catch in choosing which elements to pair. How do we ensure that the algorithm always makes the best choice for future operations too?

**Elena**: Right, each choice affects subsequent decisions. Perhaps we might need to try multiple paths and compare outcomes. It's not just the immediate GCD that's important, but the overall score after n operations.

**Miguel**: Implementing that efficiently will be the key. Maybe we should represent the array as a bitmask to keep track of which elements are still available.

**Tina**: I love the bitmask idea! It would make state representation for memoization much cleaner. We'll also need a fast way to compute GCDs since that's going to be called a lot.

**Alex**: For the GCD, the Euclidean algorithm is pretty efficient. I think that'll be the least of our concerns.

**Elena**: Alright team, let's start outlining our approach. We'll use dynamic programming with the state represented as a bitmask of available numbers. For each state, we'll try all possible pairings, compute the score, and use recursion with memoization to find the maximum score achievable from that state onwards.

**Miguel**: Sounds like a solid plan! Let's also keep track of our decisions along the way, so we can reconstruct the optimal pairing sequence once we know the maximum score.

**Tina**: And let's not forget about the constraints. With n <= 7, the maximum number of states won't exceed 2^14, which is manageable.

**Alex**: I'll start working on the GCD function and test it thoroughly. We can't afford errors in such a fundamental part of our solution.

**Elena**: Great! While Alex tackles that, Miguel and Tina, could you two start mapping out the dynamic programming part? We'll regroup in an hour to integrate our parts and see how it all comes together.

**Miguel**: Will do!

**Tina**: On it!

Note: The conversation has strategically avoided the explicit solution but discussed essential elements like dynamic programming, bitmasking for state representation, recursion with memoization, and GCD calculation, aiming at developing an efficient algorithm to maximize the score based on operations described in the problem statement.
