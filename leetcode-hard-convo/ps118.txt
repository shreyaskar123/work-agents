Alex: "Hey, Jordan! I stumbled upon a cool problem today. It's about finding the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to a given number n, where their binary representations don't have consecutive ones. Thought you might have a clever approach up your sleeve."

Jordan: "Interesting challenge! Are you looking at this for numbers within a specific range?"

Alex: "Yeah, the problem states that n is a positive integer and can be up to 10^9."

Jordan: "Hmm. That's a pretty large range. A brute force approach might not be the best way then. We should probably look for a pattern or a mathematical formula that could help us avoid checking each number individually."

Alex: "Exactly! I started by manually writing out the binary representations for numbers less than 6, as an example. Noticed how only one number, which is 3, didn't fit the criteria because it has consecutive ones."

Jordan: "Interesting, so in that case, the output was 5 because all other numbers including zero fit the criteria. I suppose the first step would be identifying the binary representation of n to understand the problem's scope."

Alex: "Right. I guess we also need a way to track numerals without consecutive ones efficiently. Perhaps using some form of Fibonacci sequence or another mathematical principle? Since it seems related to a form of growth without directly adjacent repetitions."

Jordan: "That's a promising direction. The Fibonacci sequence does have a way of showing up in unexpected places. If we think about the problem abstractly, each time we add a digit in binary, we're essentially deciding whether to 'continue' a sequence without consecutive ones or 'start' a new sequence."

Alex: "Ooh, I see where you're going. So, if we represent the problem in terms of growth patterns, perhaps each step or 'digit addition' follows certain rules that mimic those in a Fibonacci sequence?"

Jordan: "Exactly! And for each step, the decision could depend on the previous steps, much like in Fibonacci. But we need to account for the binary condition of not having consecutive ones."

Alex: "That makes sense. We should probably map out sequences for smaller numbers and see if we can identify a clear pattern that relates to our Fibonacci insight. That could lead us to a mathematical formula or algorithm that doesn't require checking every number individually."

Jordan: "Absolutely. A recursive approach or even dynamic programming might be worth considering here, utilizing the patterns or the 'rules' we find. We'd need to make sure our implementation is efficient, given the possible range of n up to 10^9."

Alex: "Agreed. Let's sketch out some examples and formulas on paper. Once we have a solid understanding, moving to code should be straightforward. And we need to keep in mind base cases and the condition for non-consecutive ones."

Jordan: "I'll grab my notebook, and let's tackle this. It's like a puzzle waiting to be solved. And remember, we should verify our method with the example where n equals 5, to ensure we're on the right track."

Alex: "Sounds like a plan! Understanding this could open doors to solving similar problems. Let's dive in and see where this Fibonacci hint takes us."
