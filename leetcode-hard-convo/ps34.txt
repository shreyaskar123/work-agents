**Alex**: So, we're tackling a problem today where we have to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array.

**Jordan**: Right. It sounds like something where sorting might initially come to mind, but the follow-up challenge mentions an O(n) solution. Sorting would take us to O(n log n) at best.

**Alex**: Definitely. The key here is to think about the properties of consecutive sequences. For example, if you know a certain number is part of a sequence, you'd naturally look for the number right before it or right after it.

**Jordan**: Makes sense. So, are we thinking about iterating through the array and somehow keeping track of these sequences?

**Alex**: Precisely. Imagine if every time we encounter a number, we could somehow check if its neighbors (number - 1 and number + 1) are around without needing to sort or search through the entire array each time.

**Jordan**: Hmm, that sounds like a job for a hash set. By tossing each number into a hash set, we could achieve constant time complexity for checking the presence of neighbors.

**Alex**: Exactly! And from each number, we could then try to expand outwards in both directions, effectively building up the consecutive sequence piece by piece.

**Jordan**: So, for the example `[100,4,200,1,3,2]`, once we encounter `1`, we realize it can stretch out to `2`, then to `3`, and so on till `4`, correct?

**Alex**: Right. And to optimize, we should probably only start expanding if the current number is the start of a potential sequence. Like with `1` in your example, there's no `0`, so we know it's a starter. But when we get to `2`, we skip the expansion because `1` is right there before it.

**Jordan**: I see. So, this approach would mean we only ever expand from the beginning of sequences, ensuring we don't redundantly expand from the middle of existing ones. It's elegant because it saves a lot of unnecessary work.

**Alex**: Absolutely. And throughout this whole process, we just keep a counter for the longest sequence we've found, comparing and updating it whenever we find a longer one during our expansions.

**Jordan**: Quick question on implementation, thoughâ€”how do we manage the hash set? Do we remove numbers from it as we expand to avoid revisiting them, or do we keep them around for the sake of identifying sequence starters?

**Alex**: Good question. Keeping the numbers in the set doesn't harm our time complexity, because once a number has served as a sequence starter, even if we attempt to start a sequence from it again, we'll quickly find it has neighbors and skip the expansion. It's a little more memory intensive but keeps the logic straightforward.

**Jordan**: That makes sense. I'm starting to see how this hashes out... pun intended. This method seems efficient for meeting the constraints and the follow-up challenge as well.

**Alex**: Exactly, and it's a great representation of transforming the problem into a more manageable form using appropriate data structures. It's always about finding those key insights.

**Jordan**: Absolutely. This was a productive discussion. I feel equipped to tackle this now, or at least draft an initial solution and iterate from there. Thanks for breaking it down, Alex.

**Alex**: Anytime, Jordan. These kinds of problems really sharpen your problem-solving skills. Let's revisit this approach with another problem in our next session.
