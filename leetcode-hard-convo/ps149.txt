Alex: Hey, Jamie and Pat, have you two checked out that cherry collection problem? I think there could be a really interesting approach to maximizing the cherry pick-up.

Jamie: Oh, the one with the `n x n` grid filled with cherries, empty spots, and thorns? Yep, it does sound challenging. Starting at `(0, 0)` and going to `(n - 1, n - 1)` and back, right?

Pat: Exactly. The trick is, each cherry you pick turns the cell empty. So, the route planning is crucial here. If you just run through it without a strategy, you might end up with less than the maximum cherries.

Alex: Totally. I was thinking about using dynamic programming to keep track of the best paths. But the catch is how we consider both journeys, to and fro, while making sure we don’t run into thorns.

Jamie: That’s a good point. I’d say a vital part of tackling this problem is to think about the grid in terms of states. Like, considering each cell by its coordinates and the remaining steps.

Pat: Right, and maybe we could use some form of memoization to avoid recalculating paths. However, how do we account for the cherry that gets picked up? I mean, once we pick a cherry, the state of the grid changes.

Alex: That’s where thinking about the problem in terms of two trips could simplify things. Instead of one long trip, we consider the journey to `(n-1, n-1)` and back as separate but dependent problems.

Jamie: I see, so it’s like breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable problems. But how would we track the optimal path without actually removing cherries along the way? There must be a way to simulate both journeys without altering the grid prematurely.

Pat: For sure, Jamie. It seems like for each cell, we need to consider the maximum cherries we could collect from all four possible directions. But then, this sounds computationally heavy.

Alex: Right, but if we cleverly use memoization, we can drastically reduce the number of computations. It basically boils down to finding a way to effectively cache and retrieve the best paths without having to recompute them.

Jamie: That makes sense. So, it’s more about finding a smart way to navigate through the grid, note down our findings, and then use those findings to make informed decisions about which path to take next.

Pat: Exactly, and remember, if there’s no valid path, then the problem sort of solves itself since no cherries can be collected. I think we need to first make sure we can reach `(n - 1, n - 1)` before thinking about cherry pick-ups.

Alex: That’s a great point, Pat. Ensuring there’s a valid path even without considering cherries is step one. Then optimize the cherry collection on top of that path.

Jamie: It’s going to be interesting to see how we can implement this. Balancing between finding a valid path and maximizing cherry pick-ups, all while dealing with the changing state of the grid.

Pat: Absolutely. I believe starting with a brute force method to understand the problem and then gradually optimizing by identifying redundant paths should pave the way forward.

Alex: Agreed. Let’s sketch out some pseudo-code and start experimenting with different approaches. We might discover some patterns we can exploit to make our solution more efficient.

Jamie: Sounds like a plan. Exploring those patterns will definitely shine some light on optimizing our trips through the grid.

Pat: And, we need to keep an eye on the performance, especially since the grid can be up to `50 x 50`. Shall we start outlining our approach then dive into coding?

Alex: Let’s do it. With a combination of dynamic programming and smart memoization, I’m confident we can crack this.
