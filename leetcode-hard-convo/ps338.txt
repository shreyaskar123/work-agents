**Edward**: Good morning, team! Okay, let's start today's meeting by discussing the algorithm challenge we've been given. It's about a very unusual printer.

**Alex**: Yeah, I saw that. It prints solid rectangles with the restriction of using each color only once. Our task is to find out if a given `targetGrid` can be printed following these rules.

**Jamie**: Right. I was thinking about how, conceptually, we need to reverse engineer the painting process. It's like peeling back layers of an onion to see if we could have started with blank canvas.

**Morgan**: Exactly, Jamie. The key here might be to see if we can sort the colors in some sort of sequence that allows us to validate the 'painting' process. Like, starting from the last color used and moving backwards.

**Edward**: I like where this is going. So, we're thinking about checking if each color can be printed in a way that doesn't violate the constraint of reusing colors, right?

**Alex**: Yeah, and it sounds like a layers problem, but also a bounds-checking problem. Figuring out whether a color forms a solid rectangle that could have been printed in one go seems critical.

**Jamie**: Exactly! And what if we track the boundaries of where each color appears? If the boundaries of a color aren't consistent with forming a solid rectangle, it means the grid can't be painted according to the rules.

**Morgan**: That's a great point, Jamie. But we also need to make sure there are no colors 'trapped' inside that rectangle that haven't been printed yet. Every layer should only reveal colors that have been printed or the base canvas.

**Edward**: So, it sounds like we're leaning towards some sort of breadth-first search algorithm, where we start with the outermost colors and work our way in. But there's also this aspect of making sure subsequent layers are consistent?

**Alex**: Right, and we'd need to be careful about the order in which colors are checked. There might be a need for a priority system based on the dependencies of colors on one another.

**Jamie**: Yeah, identifying dependencies is crucial. A color that appears later can depend on earlier colors but not the other way around. That could help in ruling out impossible scenarios quickly.

**Morgan**: Let's not forget the edge cases. Like single-color grids or grids where one color wraps around another. They might test the robustness of our approach.

**Edward**: Great points, everyone. It sounds like we should break down this problem into smaller tasks: identifying the sequence of colored rectangles, checking if each rectangle can exist based on the ones before it, and ensuring no color dependencies are violated.

**Alex**: Before we wrap up, do we need to model this in code?

**Jamie**: We should draft pseudo-code first, touching upon all the points we've discussed. Like starting with identifying the rectangles, then establishing their sequence, and finally, checking the validity concerning the printing rules.

**Morgan**: Agreed. Let's get those steps outlined, and then we can delegate who works on what part. This way, we can regroup and piece together our solution for a solid understanding of how to tackle similar problems in the future.

**Edward**: Perfect. That's the plan then. By the end of this, we'll have a comprehensive understanding without directly jumping onto code. Let's reconvene after sketching out our parts. Great brainstorming session, team!
