Alex: Hey there, was hoping we could tackle that expression simplification problem today. I’ve been scratching my head about it.

Jordan: Absolutely, it sounds like a fun challenge. We’re dealing with parsing and simplifying mathematical expressions, right?

Taylor: Exactly. Let’s consider an example to kick things off. Say we have `expression = "e + 8 - a + 5"` and our evaluation map is `{"e": 1}`. How do you think we should approach simplifying it?

Alex: First, we need to parse the expression, right? We could treat it as a series of chunks and symbols based on the spaces.

Jordan: Yeah, and variables are lowercase letters. Plus, we have to apply the evaluation map which replaces certain variables with specified integers.

Taylor: That's a good point. For the evaluation map, we replace each instance of `e` with `1`. So, after substitution, our expression looks like this "1 + 8 - a + 5".

Alex: Got it. The next step is simplifying that expression. We’ll have to handle basic arithmetic and also maintain the order of operations.

Jordan: Precisely. And we should be mindful of how we represent variables and coefficients in the output. The format specified requires sorted variables and proper placement of coefficients.

Taylor: So, if we simplify "1 + 8 - a + 5", what should the output look like in the correct format?

Alex: We do the arithmetic first for constants. So, 1 + 8 + 5 gives us 14. Since `a` is being subtracted, it would be treated as `-1 * a`. 

Jordan: Right. So the final simplified expression would be represented as `["-1*a", "14"]`, which is indeed the expected output.

Taylor: Exactly. Now, what if there are multiple variables or parentheses involved? Say, an expression like `"a * b * c + b * a * c * 4"`?

Alex: I suppose we’d follow the same initial steps, but multiplication introduces variable terms that need to be combined according to their degree and lexicographic order.

Jordan: True. Also, when there are parentheses, we need to evaluate those expressions first before simplifying the outer expression.

Taylor: And remember, terms with a coefficient of 0 are excluded from the final output, simplifying the expression further.

Alex: Seems like parsing the expression accurately is half the battle. After that, it’s applying mathematical principles to simplify and sort the terms.

Jordan: Absolutely. Keeping track of coefficients and variables while maintaining order will be crucial. Should we dive into writing some pseudo-code or sketch out an algorithm flow?

Taylor: Might be a great next step. Let’s ensure we’re clear on handling every aspect of the problem, including edge cases and the specific output formatting rules.

Alex: Definitely. Handling the input correctly and ensuring we’re accurately applying operations in the right order will be key.

Jordan: Sounds like a plan. Let's get started on breaking this problem down further and sketch out our approach in detail.
