**Alex**: Morning, Tyler and Jordan. Thanks for joining the brainstorming session. We’ve got a bit of a task ahead with this MajorityChecker class.

**Tyler**: Morning! I read through the specifications you sent over. It’s an intriguing problem. Breaking down the API, we're essentially looking at frequency analysis within subarrays, right?

**Jordan**: Yeah, exactly. The key challenge seems to lie in optimizing the query operations. Given the constraints mentioned, brute force approaches might not cut it for all cases.

**Alex**: Spot on. Let's start with the constructor, `MajorityChecker(int[] arr)`. It's clear the initial array `arr` will play a central role. Any preprocessing ideas to speed up our queries?

**Tyler**: Preprocessing could be valuable. One approach could involve segment trees or binary indexed trees for fast frequency lookups. Though, that might get complex with the need to identify the majority element.

**Jordan**: True, and considering the `query` function, where we're given a left and right bound and a threshold, we could potentially leverage a divide and conquer technique, but adapting it to efficiently find a majority threshold could be tricky.

**Alex**: Right, the efficiency of `query(int left, int right, int threshold)` is crucial. Given the `2 * threshold > right - left + 1` condition, we're always looking for a distinct majority. Does this remind you of any specific algorithms or patterns?

**Tyler**: It does hint at the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, where you find a majority element by offsetting pairs of different elements. However, the twist here is applying it in a dynamic array slice context.

**Jordan**: Implementing Boyer-Moore might give us a starting point. But considering dynamic subarrays, we could think about a way of making these majority element lookups more efficient. Maybe some form of memoization or storing intermediate results?

**Alex**: I like where this is going. Memoization could help, especially if we cache results of frequent queries or compute majority elements in segments of the array. What about handling the `-1` case where no majority exists based on the threshold?

**Tyler**: We'd have to incorporate a validation check after finding a potential majority. Basically, a secondary pass within the query bounds to ensure the count meets or exceeds the threshold. 

**Jordan**: And for scalability and meeting those query constraints, we should stress test with maximum array sizes and the max number of queries. It's critical our solution remains efficient under those conditions.

**Alex**: Exactly, testing will be as crucial as the implementation itself. Great points, everyone. Let’s start sketching some pseudocode based on these discussions. We need a robust structure to support the `MajorityChecker` functionalities, keeping an eye on those tricky edge cases and ensuring we can handle the high query load.

**Tyler**: Sounds good. I'll look into refining the concept around segment trees and how we might adapt or combine them with the voting algorithm logic for our needs.

**Jordan**: I’ll explore the memoization strategy and how we can intelligently cache information to minimize recalculations. Also, I'll think about an efficient validation mechanism for the post-majority-finding phase.

**Alex**: Excellent. Let’s reconvene with our findings and approaches this afternoon. We’ve got a solid direction, and with a bit of innovation, we can tackle the performance bottlenecks ahead. Thanks, team.
