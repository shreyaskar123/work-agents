Mia: So, we're tasked with finding the minimum number of semesters to complete all courses considering their dependencies and the limit of courses we can take per semester. It feels a bit like solving a puzzle, right?

Alex: Definitely. It’s like we're planning our own course schedule, but we have to optimize for the least amount of time. The first thing that comes to mind is representing the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph.

Jordan: Right, each course could be a node, and the prerequisites are the edges pointing towards the courses that require them. Since it’s guaranteed that we can complete all courses, we know the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG.

Mia: That’s a good point. And in a DAG, we can perform a topological sort to determine the order in which courses can be taken. However, the challenge is we can only take up to `k` courses each semester.

Alex: I think we need to modify the topological sort then. Instead of just ordering the courses, we should group them into the largest possible sets of courses per semester, constrained by `k` and the dependencies.

Jordan: That sounds like a plan. But don’t forget, the dependencies mean we can't just take any `k` courses. We have to ensure that for any course we plan to take in a semester, all its prerequisites have been taken in the previous semesters.

Mia: So, for each semester, we should select courses that have all their prerequisites satisfied. But, how do we deal with choosing the optimal set of courses each semester to minimize the total number of semesters?

Alex: It might involve some kind of breadth-first search, where we explore all possible combinations of courses we can take each semester.

Jordan: Yeah, and maybe we can use a queue to keep track of the courses that are available to take, as in, those whose prerequisites are fully satisfied. Every step, we try to take up to `k` courses from this queue.

Mia: That makes sense. And every time we take a course, we’d update the status of its dependent courses, checking if they’re now available to take in the next semester.

Alex: Right, we'd have to iterate this process, semester by semester, until we've taken all courses. For the actual implementation, we might need to keep a count of incoming edges for each node to efficiently find when a course becomes available.

Jordan: Also, keeping a running total of semesters and updating it as we exhaust all possible courses per semester would help us find the minimum semesters needed.

Mia: Sounds like we have a solid approach. We just have to be careful of handling edge cases, like when there are no dependencies, and we can freely choose courses up to `k` each semester.

Alex: True, those cases should actually simplify our logic, as we can just divide the total course count by `k` and round up to account for partial semesters.

Jordan: I think we've outlined a pretty solid strategy. Let’s start coding and see if we can get this algorithm up and running.
