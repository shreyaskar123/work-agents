**Alex**: Hey Jordan, I've been thinking about that coding problem you mentioned the other day. The one about counting the different ways to stay at index 0 with a given number of steps and array length. Got any insights on how to approach it?

**Jordan**: Oh, definitely! It's a pretty interesting problem. The first thing that comes to mind is using dynamic programming. Since the problem involves counting ways and has overlapping subproblems, memoization seems like a natural fit.

**Charlie**: Right, I heard you two discussing this. If I understand correctly, at each step, we have three choices: move left, move right, or stay. But isn't managing the state a bit tricky given the constraints?

**Alex**: Exactly, the state management seems like the heart of the challenge. We'd need to keep track of the current step and the current index, right?

**Jordan**: Yes, we're on the same page. Now consider that to prevent going out of bounds, the maximum distance you can ever be from index 0 is limited by the number of steps remaining. This insight can significantly reduce the state space we need to consider.

**Charlie**: That's a neat optimization. It sounds like something akin to pruning in backtracking problems.

**Alex**: Alright, but how do we structure the dynamic programming table? Are we thinking a 2D table here?

**Jordan**: Precisely, a 2D table where one dimension represents the step we're on, and the other represents the current position in the array. We'll fill this table based on the recursive relation that ties the current state to the possible next states.

**Charlie**: And I suppose the base case would be somewhat straightforward, focusing on when we have no steps left?

**Alex**: I'm curious about how we'll handle transitions. Especially the 'staying in the same place' part. 

**Jordan**: Good question. For each state, represented by the current step and position, we'll consider transitions from the direct previous step. This involves adding up the ways to get to the current state from the immediate left, right, and the same position from the previous step.

**Charlie**: Got it. And for the implementation details, we should be mindful of the modulo operation, right?

**Jordan**: Absolutely, the answer might get large, so keeping each step of our computation modulo \(10^9 + 7\) helps to avoid overflow and adheres to the problem's constraints.

**Alex**: This has been enlightening. I guess the last piece of the puzzle is initializing our DP table and iterating through the possible states in a logical order.

**Jordan**: Right. We bootstrap with the base case where the only way to be at index 0 with 0 steps is to, well, not move at all. From there, we iterate over steps and then over the positions we can be in at that step, applying our recursive formula.

**Charlie**: It sounds like we've got a solid game plan. Handling edge cases, especially with array bounds, will be vital too.

**Alex**: Definitely. Thanks for the discussion, folks. I feel much more prepared to tackle this now. Let's reconvene later and share our progress!

**Jordan**: Sounds like a plan. Happy coding, everyone!
