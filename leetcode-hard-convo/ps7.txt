**Alex**: Hey Jamie, have you ever encountered that leetcode problem about finding distinct subsequences? It's got me stumped.

**Jamie**: Oh, the one where you're given two strings, and you need to find out how many distinct subsequences of the first string equal the second string?

**Alex**: Exactly that one! It sounds simple when you say it like that, but when you dive into it, it's pretty hard. I can't seem to wrap my head around a strategy to solve it.

**Jamie**: Yeah, it's a classic dynamic programming problem. The basic idea is to build a solution incrementally using previously solved subproblems.

**Alex**: Dynamic programming, huh? I've dabbled in it but never thought to apply it here. So, how do you start?

**Jamie**: First, you need to understand the substructure of the problem. Think about how you could represent the problem as a table where each cell represents a subproblem.

**Alex**: Oh, like tabulation? Where each cell builds on the results of the previous cells?

**Jamie**: Exactly! You can create a 2D table where rows represent characters from the first string and columns represent characters from the second string.

**Alex**: Okay, I'm with you. But what do the cells represent?

**Jamie**: Each cell represents the number of distinct subsequences up to that point. The trick is to find a relation between the current cell and the previous cells.

**Alex**: Ah, so if a character in the first string matches a character in the second string, there's a certain way to update the cell?

**Jamie**: Right, you'll need to consider both the scenario when you include the matching character in your subsequence and when you exclude it. Both choices affect your count differently.

**Alex**: Makes sense. And, I suppose there's a base case?

**Jamie**: Definitely. Think about what the number of distinct subsequences would be when either the first string is empty or the second string is empty. That'll help you initialize the table.

**Alex**: Got it. And once the table is filled, the answer would be in the last cell, corresponding to the full lengths of both strings?

**Jamie**: Precisely! The table essentially encapsulates all the paths you took to build up the subsequences, reflecting all the choices you made along the way.

**Alex**: This is starting to make a lot more sense. So, by following this approach, you can break down what seems like a complex problem into manageable pieces.

**Jamie**: Exactly. The beauty of dynamic programming. It might also help to write out a small example and manually fill in the table to solidify your understanding.

**Alex**: That sounds like a great next step. Thanks, Jamie! I think I have a much clearer idea of how to tackle this problem now.

**Jamie**: Anytime, Alex. Happy coding, and let me know how it goes!
