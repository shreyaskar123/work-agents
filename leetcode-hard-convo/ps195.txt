**Alex:** Hey, everyone! Have you had a chance to look into the super-palindrome challenge I sent over earlier?

**Jordan:** Oh, yes, I did! That's quite an interesting problem. We need to count the super-palindromes within a given range, right?

**Sam:** Exactly. And a number is considered a super-palindrome if it's a palindrome itself and the square of a palindrome. The tricky part is the ranges given as strings.

**Alex:** So, we are dealing with potentially massive numbers here given the range up to 10^18. It's definitely something we can’t brute-force through traditional palindromic checks and square roots.

**Jordan:** True, brute-forcing would take an impractical amount of time. Instead, we should focus on generating palindromes and then checking which of these, when squared, stay palindromes.

**Sam:** Right. The generation part is fascinating. Considering palindromes mirror around their center, we can generate half of the palindrome and mirror it to get the full number.

**Alex:** That sounds efficient. We could start with shorter lengths and increase, mirroring each side. But how do we deal with the numerical range constraint effectively?

**Jordan:** Ah, for the range, we convert the `left` and `right` from strings to numbers initially. While generating palindromes, we can square them and check if the square falls within our target range. That'll keep our checks efficient.

**Sam:** There's also the aspect of how we square the number and ensure the result is still a palindrome. It would be pointless to check non-palindromic squares.

**Alex:** Indeed. The mathematical properties of palindromes should give us a shortcut there. So, it’s less about checking every number and more about smart generation and verification within bounds.

**Jordan:** And given the constraint of up to 18 digits, generating palindromes directly could help us mitigate the computational load significantly. We just need to be wary of overflow issues during squaring, given the upper range.

**Sam:** Another point to consider is optimizing our palindrome checks. Since we'll be generating them, there's potential to avoid checking each digit individually.

**Alex:** True, leveraging the generation process itself could implicitly ensure we're dealing with palindromes. The key takeaway seems to be strategic generation rather than random checks.

**Jordan:** Precisely. The solution hinges on our ability to efficiently generate valid candidate palindromes and then checking those candidates’ squares against our range.

**Sam:** It sounds like we have a solid conceptual approach. We generate, we mirror, we check the squared value, and we keep within bounds, ensuring we manage the numerical conversions effectively.

**Alex:** Great discussion, team. Let’s start implementing these ideas with an eye on optimizing each part of the process. We can break it down into manageable tasks and reconvene to amalgamate our findings.

**Jordan:** Sounds like a plan. Let’s get to it and make those super-palindromes less mysterious.

**Sam:** Agreed. I'm curious to see how many of these numbers we can unearth within our given range. Let’s reconvene with our progress soon.
