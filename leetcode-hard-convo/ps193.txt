**Ava**: Hey, guys. Glad we could meet up. I've been racking my brain on how to approach this problem I ran into. It's about generating positive integers using a set of digits, under a certain limit `n`.

**Eli**: Interesting, sounds like a fun algorithmic challenge. Can you give a bit more detail on the problem?

**Ava**: Sure. So, we have an array of digits sorted in non-decreasing order. We're tasked with figuring out how many positive integers we can generate that are less than or equal to a given integer `n`. The twist is, we can use each digit as many times as we want.

**Sam**: Ah, got it. It's like having an assortment of building blocks, and we're seeing how many different structures we can build, just that here our structures are numbers.

**Ava**: Exactly, Sam. For instance, if our digits array is ['1', '3', '5'], we can form numbers like '13', '551', or even '1351315', assuming they're under our limit `n`.

**Eli**: That makes sense. So, if we're looking at digits ['1', '4', '9'] and our limit `n` is a large number, say 1000000000, we're interested in knowing how many unique numbers we can write out.

**Sam**: Right, and I suppose the challenge partly lies in not just counting single or double-digit numbers, but considering all possible lengths up to the largest number less than `n` we can form with those digits.

**Ava**: Correct. And keep in mind, numbers should not start with zero, but that's implicitly handled since our digits range from '1' to '9'. Another thing is the array of digits is sorted, which should simplify our logic in a way.

**Eli**: To start, shouldn't we first figure out the maximum number of digits any of our generated numbers can have? After all, we're limited by `n`.

**Sam**: Definitely. That gives us a starting point. From there, it's about iterating through possible numbers with x digits, where x ranges from 1 up to that maximum.

**Ava**: And for each length, we have to calculate how many unique numbers we can form using our given digits.

**Eli**: It seems like a combination of understanding permutations with repetition and also being mindful of our upper limit `n`.

**Sam**: Yes, and for larger `n`, counting directly could be inefficient. We might need to get a bit clever with math and possibly dynamic programming to avoid recalculating anything we've already figured out.

**Ava**: Agreed. What about tackling the problem by considering how many numbers we can form of a certain length and then using the digits array to incrementally build up to our solution?

**Eli**: That sounds like a plan. We should also remember to handle edge cases, like when our digits array restricts us in a way that makes it impossible to reach close to `n` with our combinations.

**Sam**: Before we dive deeper, it might also be worth outlining a step-by-step approach or algorithm on paper. Breaking it down into smaller chunks could help visualize the problem better.

**Ava**: Absolutely, a bit of pseudo-coding or drafting an algorithm could pave the way forward. Let's start with that and reconvene to fine-tune our approach.

**Eli**: Sounds good. And as we do that, let's keep in mind any optimizations that might simplify our logic or reduce computational overhead.

**Sam**: Great, looking forward to seeing what we come up with. This is a good mix of logic, math, and programmingâ€”a fun challenge indeed.

**Ava**: Awesome, let's get to it then. Thanks, guys, for brainstorming with me. I think we're on the right track to solving this.
