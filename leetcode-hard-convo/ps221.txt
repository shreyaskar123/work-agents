**Jasmine:** Hey, everyone gathered up? I wanted to walk through implementing a new feature â€“ a StreamChecker class. It's an interesting problem where we need to check if the last `k` characters queried spell one of the given words.

**Alex:** That sounds like a decent challenge. So, we're looking at individual letters coming in, and we need to figure out if any of the sequences match our list of words?

**Jasmine:** Exactly, Alex. We initialize our StreamChecker with a list of words, then every time we get a new letter, we need to check if it completes any word from our initialization list.

**Marco:** I'm thinking about the data structure to hold our words. Because we're dealing with sequences, a Trie might be a handy choice here. It could let us efficiently search through the characters we've received so far.

**Jasmine:** Great point, Marco. A Trie could indeed help us match sequences efficiently as we receive new letters. Think of each node in the Trie representing a character from one of our words.

**Alex:** Makes sense. How would we handle the query part? This looks like the most challenging aspect since we have to keep checking the sequences every time a new letter comes in.

**Jasmine:** Well, that's where the Trie comes into play. Each time we query with a new letter, we essentially traverse the Trie. We also need a way to keep track of our position within the Trie for consecutive queries.

**Marco:** Ah, that means we also need to maintain a history of letters queried so far, right? But given the constraints, holding all the previous queries might be inefficient.

**Jasmine:** Precisely, Marco. Instead of storing all characters ever queried, we could optimize by keeping just enough history relevant to the longest word in our initialization list. We slide this window of relevant history through the Trie as more letters come in.

**Alex:** That's smart; it significantly reduces the memory footprint. For each query, we'd start at the root of our Trie and traverse down according to the history we've maintained. If at any point we reach the end of a word in the Trie, we return true.

**Jasmine:** Yes, and importantly, if at any point we can't proceed down the Trie because the current letter doesn't match, we can instantly return false for that query.

**Marco:** This would also mean optimizing our Trie structure to quickly indicate if a node is the end of a valid word, right? 

**Jasmine:** Exactly. Each node can have a flag indicating whether it's the end of a word. This way, as we traverse with our query string, if we hit such a node, we know our query has succeeded.

**Alex:** I see how this all fits together now. The Trie helps us efficiently manage our word list, and by smartly tracking our queries' recent history, we can quickly determine if we have a match. It's like we're dynamically building and checking strings against our Trie structure.

**Jasmine:** That's a great summary, Alex. This approach balances between time complexity and space, considering the number of words and queries we need to handle. Let's start sketching this out and see if we need any adjustments as we dive deeper.

**Marco:** Sounds like a plan. Working through the Trie implementation and optimizing our query history will be crucial.

**Alex:** I'm on board. Let's get this StreamChecker rolling and see it in action!

**Jasmine:** Awesome, teamwork makes the dream work! Thanks for brainstorming this, everyone. Let's reconvene later with our initial drafts and tackle any hurdles then.
