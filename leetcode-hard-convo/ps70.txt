**Emma:** Hey, Alex and Jordan! Thanks for joining the brainstorming session today. I bumped into a problem that needs some creative thinkers. It's about finding the longest increasing path in a matrix. Any thoughts on how we could approach it?

**Alex:** Interesting! So, we're looking at a grid where we can move up, down, left, or right but not diagonally, right? And we want the longest sequence where each number is greater than the previous one.

**Jordan:** Yeah, that sounds about right. My first thought goes towards using Depth-First Search (DFS). We could explore each path from every cell.

**Emma:** DFS, perfect! But wouldn't that be inefficient if we blindly check every path, especially for large matrices?

**Alex:** Good point, Emma. What if we use a memoization technique to store results of paths we've already explored? That way, we don't re-calculate paths unnecessarily.

**Jordan:** Right, like, if a cell has a value that proceeds in an increasing path, we could store the length of the longest path starting from that cell. This saves us from revisiting and recalculating paths.

**Emma:** Exactly! So, for each cell, we perform DFS and use memoization to record the length of the longest increasing path starting from that cell. 

**Alex:** I do wonder, though. For memoization, we'd need some sort of data structure, right? An auxiliary matrix, perhaps?

**Jordan:** Yeah, a 2D array the same size as the input matrix should work. It can store the length of the longest path from each cell. Initially, it could be filled with zeros, indicating that we haven't explored those cells yet.

**Emma:** And during our DFS, we should also ensure that we only move to adjacent cells which have greater values, respecting the problem's constraints on movement.

**Alex:** That brings up boundary checks. We must make sure our search doesn't go off the edges of the matrix.

**Jordan:** True. If we carefully implement the DFS, considering the constraints and memoization, it should lead us to the right solution. Once we've explored all possible paths, we can go through our storage array to find the maximum value, which represents the length of the longest increasing path.

**Emma:** Brilliant! It sounds like a plan. Does anyone want to discuss handling the base cases or specific scenarios that we should be aware of in our implementation?

**Alex:** One scenario that comes to mind is matrices with only one element. Our algorithm should simply return 1, as there's nowhere to move, but the single element itself forms a valid path.

**Jordan:** Also, considering the problem's constraint that the matrix's size is up to \(200 \times 200\), our solution should be optimized enough to handle such cases without significant performance issues.

**Emma:** Those are valid points. Ensuring our solution can efficiently handle edge cases and large inputs is crucial. With this approach, I feel confident we could crack the problem. Let's start drafting some pseudo-code and divide tasks to begin implementation.

**Alex:** Agreed! I can focus on the DFS function and ensure it accurately explores and returns the path lengths.

**Jordan:** And I'll work on the memoization logic and ensure that our auxiliary matrix is utilized efficiently.

**Emma:** Perfect! I'll oversee the integration of our components and handle edge cases and testing. Thanks, team. Let's reconvene with our parts soon and piece together the solution.
