**Emma**: So, we have an interesting problem on our hands regarding traversing an undirected graph with three types of edges. The goal is to remove the maximum number of edges while ensuring the graph remains fully traversable by both Alice and Bob. How do you think we should approach this?

**Liam**: It sounds like a variation of the minimum spanning tree problem, but with a twist due to the traversal restrictions. Maybe we could use a union-find algorithm to keep track of connectivity within the graph?

**Sophia**: I agree with Liam. For those unfamiliar, the union-find algorithm helps manage a collection of disjoint sets, which in this case can represent the connectivity within the graph for Alice, Bob, or both.

**Mason**: Right, so we need to handle three different graphs effectively: one for Alice, one for Bob, and one for both. Every edge that can be traversed by both should be added to the graph for both Alice and Bob.

**Emma**: Yes, and we should prioritize adding the type 3 edges since they're useful for both Alice and Bob. After we've processed those, we can see which type 1 and type 2 edges are absolutely necessary to maintain full traversal capability for Alice and Bob respectively.

**Liam**: It's also essential to recognize that any redundant edge, which doesn't contribute to the connectivity or makes a cycle, represents an edge we can potentially remove.

**Sophia**: Exactly, the key is to figure out how to identify those redundant edges. During the union-find process, we can keep track of when we're attempting to union two nodes that are already connected. Those scenarios indicate that the current edge could be redundant, right?

**Mason**: Definitely. However, we'll need to be careful when deciding which edges are truly redundant because an edge redundant for Alice might still be required for Bob's traversal and vice versa.

**Emma**: That's a good point, Mason. This means that after processing all type 3 edges, we should separately process type 1 and type 2 edges using the union-find technique to identify and count the truly redundant edges.

**Liam**: So, in summary, our process involves first ensuring full connectivity for both players using type 3 edges. Then, augment that with necessary type 1 and type 2 edges while counting any extra edges as potential removals.

**Sophia**: And let's not forget to handle the scenario where it's impossible to achieve full traversal for both Alice and Bob. If after adding all relevant edges, we find disconnected components for either player, we return `-1`.

**Mason**: Right, robust checks after each step are crucial. This ensures we don't overlook an impossibility scenario.

**Emma**: Sounds like we have a solid plan. Letâ€™s start implementing it and test it against various scenarios to ensure we've covered all bases.
