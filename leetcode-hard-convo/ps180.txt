**Alex**: Hey folks, so I've been mulling over this problem of calculating the total area covered by multiple axis-aligned rectangles. Have you had a chance to think about it?

**Jordan**: Yes, I have. It's quite an interesting challenge, especially considering that some rectangles might overlap. We can't just sum up the area of each rectangle to get the total area.

**Riley**: That's right, Jordan. The tricky part is managing those overlaps. You don't want to count any area more than once. I was thinking we start by breaking down the problem. Maybe we could visualize each rectangle and its placement on the plane.

**Alex**: Visualization sounds like a good start. Each rectangle can be represented by the coordinates of its bottom-left and top-right corners, right? How would we go about identifying the overlaps?

**Jordan**: Correct. If we could somehow calculate the area of each individual rectangle and then subtract the area that has been counted more than once for overlaps... But yes, identifying those overlaps is the key part.

**Riley**: There's this approach where you sort the rectangles based on their x or y coordinates. This could potentially help us in processing them in a certain order, maybe to more easily identify and manage overlaps.

**Alex**: Sorting could indeed help. We might also think about segmenting the area into non-overlapping portions somehow. Each portion can then be calculated separately and added together for the total area.

**Jordan**: And don't forget, the final answer needs to be modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is important given the size of the numbers we're dealing with.

**Riley**: Absolutely, that's a critical point for programming the solution. For each non-overlapping segment we find, we could keep a running total of the area covered, applying the modulo operation to manage the size of the number.

**Alex**: That brings up the question of data structures as well. What kind of data structure would be best suited for keeping track of these segments and their areas?

**Jordan**: Something flexible and efficient for insertions and deletions, since we might need to dynamically update our segments as we find overlaps. A balanced binary search tree, or maybe more specialized structures like a segment tree or sweep line algorithm, could be useful.

**Riley**: Sweep line! That's a neat algorithm for these kinds of geometric problems. Essentially processing events (like the start or end of a rectangle) as we sweep a line across the plane.

**Alex**: Right, so using a sweep line could help us efficiently handle the rectangles as we go, keeping track of the current state at each step and calculating areas piece by piece.

**Jordan**: This sounds like a solid plan. We'd process each "event" related to the rectangles and use an appropriate data structure to manage active segments of the line we're sweeping. Then calculate the total area by considering these segments without double counting overlaps.

**Riley**: Exactly. I think with this approach, we'd be able to handle the calculation accurately. It's just a matter of implementing it correctly, considering the modulo aspect as well.

**Alex**: Great discussion, everyone. It seems we have a promising strategy to solve this problem. Let's each work on a part of this solution and reconvene to combine our findings.

**Jordan**: Sounds like a plan. Let's take this step by step and solve this intriguing problem. Looking forward to seeing it come together!

**Riley**: Agreed! Let's get to it then. I'm excited to see how our solution shapes up.
