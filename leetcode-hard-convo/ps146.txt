**Jordan**: Welcome everyone! Let’s dive into today's topic—navigating through the challenge of finding the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in a given string, with some restrictions. 

**Alex**: Interesting you brought this up, Jordan. I assume we're focusing on strings where characters fall within 'a' to 'd'? 

**Jordan**: Right, Alex. Characters are limited to 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The crucial part to remember is we're looking for subsequences, meaning the characters don't have to be contiguous in the string.

**Sam**: Oh, palindromes but as subsequences? Sounds intricate. How do we tackle occurrences of the same palindromic subsequence but found in different parts of the given string?

**Jordan**: Excellent question, Sam. The crux is considering unique palindromic subsequences. For instance, if "bcb" appears more than once but originates from distinct sections of the string, it still counts as one unique occurrence.

**Alex**: Makes sense, Jordan. So, keeping track of what we've already found is key. But how do we manage the computational complexity here, especially with strings that could potentially extend to a thousand characters in length?

**Jordan**: Right, the sheer possibility of combinations could be overwhelming. A brute-force approach isn't practical. We need an efficient algorithm, perhaps employing dynamic programming to avoid recalculating for the same substrings or leveraging the modulo operation for the final count due to the possibility of large numbers.

**Sam**: Dynamic programming sounds like a solid strategy. Does this involve breaking down our big problem into manageable, smaller problems?

**Jordan**: Precisely, Sam. Imagine we find a way to not only calculate the number of palindromic subsequences for smaller substrings but also deduce from them the count for larger ones. Plus, remember the modulo `10^9 + 7` constraint to keep our numbers within bounds.

**Alex**: I'm curious about handling edge cases, like strings with repetitive characters or those without any palindromic subsequence. How should we incorporate those into the algorithm?

**Jordan**: We should account for both scenarios. With dynamic programming, we can efficiently handle repetitions and also ensure that even if no palindromic subsequence is found, our algorithm gracefully defaults, likely to zero.

**Sam**: This sounds comprehensive yet complex. Could you hint at the first step towards implementing such an algorithm?

**Jordan**: Without delving into specifics, think about breaking down the problem using a matrix or table to keep track of palindromes within certain indices of the string. This way, you can build upon previously found palindromes to discover new ones or increment your count.

**Alex**: Ah, so it's about optimizing the search for palindromes by remembering past calculations. That makes sense.

**Jordan**: Exactly, Alex. Smartly leveraging past information to ease future calculations is the essence of dynamic programming. Any further steps or optimizations would require a detailed look into how these palindromic subsequences overlap or influence each other’s counts. 

**Sam**: Thanks, Jordan. It feels like we're equipped with a clear direction on tackling this challenge now. Looking forward to putting this into practice!

**Jordan**: Happy to help! Remember, the key is to break down the problem and cleverly use past calculations. I'm sure you’ll all make great progress. Let's reconvene with some pseudocode and test cases next time. Happy coding, team!
