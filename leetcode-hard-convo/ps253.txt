**Alex**: Hey everyone, glad we could meet up. So, we've got this interesting problem to work through. It's about counting how many strings of a given length can be formed using specific rules.

**Jamie**: Right, I saw that. We're only dealing with lowercase vowels, and there are rules about which vowels can follow others. It sounds like a dynamic programming problem to me.

**Alex**: Exactly, Jamie. We're supposed to find out how many such strings can be formed for a given length `n`, and because the numbers can get huge, we have to return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Taylor**: So, if I got it right, for a string of length 1, the answer is pretty straightforward, right? It's just the total number of vowels we have.

**Alex**: Yes, Taylor, that's correct. The complexity starts to show when `n` is greater than 1 because of the restrictions on which vowel can follow which.

**Jamie**: I think the key here is understanding those specific rules about vowel succession. Like, `a` can only be followed by `e`, and so on. That pattern is crucial for our algorithm.

**Morgan**: Yeah, and each of those rules seems to hint at a direction for how we could set up our state definitions if we're going the dynamic programming route. Like, how the current state depends on the previous one.

**Taylor**: That makes sense. We essentially have to track how each vowel can transition to another from one character in the string to the next, ensuring we respect the given rules.

**Alex**: Right. And to handle the problem size, we'll likely need to build up from smaller subproblems, storing our results to avoid recalculating them. This way, we can just add up the valid combinations as we extend the strings.

**Jamie**: Do you think we could sketch out a matrix, where the rows represent the string length, and the columns represent the last vowel used? This could help us visualize the transitions from one vowel to another.

**Morgan**: I like that idea, Jamie. Each cell could represent the total count of strings ending with that vowel for the given length. Then we'll have to update each cell based on the transition rules.

**Taylor**: And for each increase in `n`, we update our counts based on the previous counts and the rules of succession. That iterative process should help us build up to the answer for any given `n`.

**Alex**: Exactly. Don't forget about the modulo part; it's easy to overlook until you're met with a surprisingly large number during computation.

**Jamie**: Definitely. Keeping the numbers manageable will be crucial, especially since `n` can go up to `2 * 10^4`. We have to incorporate the modulo operation neatly into our updates.

**Morgan**: Once we've got our algorithm down, we can run it through some sample inputs, like `n=1`, which we already know, and then something bigger like `n=2` or `n=5`, to ensure it's working as expected.

**Taylor**: This feels like a solid plan. Start simple, understand the rules, build the dynamic programming solution with careful attention to state transitions, and always apply the modulo operation.

**Alex**: Perfect, let's start drafting this out then, and test as we go. We've got a good handle on what needs to be done. Thanks, team!
