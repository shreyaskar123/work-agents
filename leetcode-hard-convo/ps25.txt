**Ella**: Hey folks, glad we could all meet up today. We've got an interesting problem on our hands with finding the largest rectangle area in a histogram. Have any of you taken a look at it yet?

**Jordan**: Yeah, I saw the problem statement you sent over. It's about calculating the maximum area possible for a rectangle within a histogram, where the height of the bars in the histogram are given in an array, right?

**Ella**: Exactly, Jordan. And to give it more context, consider a scenario where we have an array `heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]`. We want to find the largest rectangle that can fit into this histogram. The challenge is figuring out how to do that efficiently.

**Mia**: So, it seems like the naïve approach would be to consider every possible pair of bars and calculate the area, but that sounds very inefficient. There must be a better way to tackle this.

**Ella**: Spot on, Mia. The brute force method would indeed be too slow, especially considering the constraint that we could have up to 105 elements in our array. We need something more efficient. Has anyone thought of a strategy that could work?

**Jordan**: Well, I was thinking about utilizing the stack data structure in some way. It seems like it could help in keeping track of bars that could potentially form larger rectangles, especially as we traverse the array.

**Mia**: That makes sense, Jordan. Using a stack could help us maintain the bars in an increasing order of their heights, and as soon as we find a bar that breaks this increasing trend, we can start calculating areas of rectangles with the bars stored in the stack.

**Ella**: Right, Jordan and Mia. And how would we go about calculating the area? What specific information do we need to keep on the stack to make those calculations?

**Jordan**: I think for each bar, if we keep track of its index besides its height, we could use the current index to determine the width of the rectangle. When a bar at the top of the stack gets popped because we've found a shorter bar, we then calculate the area of the rectangle that bar could form using the height of the popped bar and the distance between the current index and the index of the new top of the stack.

**Mia**: And for calculating the area of rectangles formed by bars still left on the stack at the end of the array traversal, we'd treat the end of the array as the end of the last rectangle, right?

**Ella**: Exactly, Mia. And remember, since the width of each bar is 1, the width of the rectangle would essentially be the number of consecutive bars that can form that rectangle. Does everyone feel comfortable with the principles behind this approach? We might not have covered every tiny detail, but hopefully, the strategy is clear.

**Jordan**: Yeah, it's definitely making more sense. It sounds like a lot of the work is in correctly managing the stack and knowing when to push and pop bars while calculating areas.

**Mia**: Agreed. It’s about understanding the sequence of heights and how they contribute to potential areas. I'm keen to try coding this out.

**Ella**: Great! Let's each attempt to implement this strategy. Remember, the aim is not just to solve the problem but to also write efficient and clean code. Happy coding, everyone! Let’s reconvene later and discuss our solutions.
