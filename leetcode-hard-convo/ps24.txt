**Alex:** Hey, Jordan. Got a sec? I've stumbled upon a challenge and could use a fresh perspective.

**Jordan:** Sure, Alex. What's up?

**Alex:** It’s this problem where we need to find the minimum window in a string `s` that contains all characters of another string `t`. Ever come across something like that?

**Jordan:** Oh, yeah. That sounds like a classic sliding window problem. What’s your approach?

**Alex:** I was thinking of using two pointers to create a window in `s` and then expand or shrink the window to find the minimum length window that contains all `t` characters.

**Jordan:** Right, that’s a solid start. How are you planning to check if the window contains all characters of `t` efficiently?

**Alex:** I thought about using a hashmap to keep track of the characters in `t` and their counts. That way, I can adjust the counts as characters enter or leave the window and check if the window is valid.

**Jordan:** Makes sense. You’ll need to ensure you have a quick way to know if the current window is a valid solution, right?

**Alex:** Exactly. I was thinking of having a counter that tracks how many unique characters from `t` are currently matched in the window. If this count equals the number of unique characters in `t`, we know the window is valid.

**Jordan:** Smart. Just remember to update your minimum window size and take note of its start position each time you find a smaller valid window.

**Alex:** Got it. Any ideas on how to make sure this runs in O(n) time?

**Jordan:** Well, the key is in how you shift your window. You don't want to shrink or expand one character at a time blindly. Think about which conditions allow you to expand or shrink your window more aggressively.

**Alex:** So, it's like, if my window isn’t valid, I expand by moving the end pointer, and if it’s valid, I try to shrink it by moving the start pointer without breaking the validity.

**Jordan:** Exactly! And you always update your minimum window size when you find a smaller valid window. This approach ensures you only traverse each character of `s` a constant number of times, keeping it within O(n).

**Alex:** That gives me a good starting point. I’ll need to handle some edge cases, like what if `s` is shorter than `t`, or if no valid window exists.

**Jordan:** Right. Always good to handle those up front. It's cleaner than catching them as special cases later in your logic.

**Alex:** This was super helpful, Jordan. Thanks for helping me hash this out!

**Jordan:** My pleasure, Alex. Always here for a good algorithm chat. Let me know how it goes!
