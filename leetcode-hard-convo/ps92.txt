**Alex:** Alright team, let's tackle this design challenge - building an efficient Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache system. Our goal is to ensure both `get` and `put` operations can be done in possibly O(1) time. How should we start?

**Morgan:** First thing, since we're dealing with frequency of use, we need a way to keep track of how often each key is accessed. A counter for each key seems necessary.

**Jamie:** Right, and we also need to account for ties. When frequencies are the same, we use the Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy. It sounds like we need to track both frequency and recent usage.

**Alex:** Exactly. For tracking frequency, what if we use a hash map where keys map to their frequency count? And for maintaining the order of recent usage within the same frequency, perhaps another structure?

**Morgan:** That makes sense. We could use another hash map to map frequencies to a set of keys with that frequency. To handle the LRU aspect, this set could actually be an ordered data structure, like a linked list.

**Jamie:** Okay, but we also need to update these structures efficiently when a `get` or `put` operation happens. Incrementing frequency, updating recent usage order... it could get complex quickly.

**Alex:** True. For updating frequencies, if we move a key from one frequency list to another, it involves removing it from the current list and adding it to the next. That operation has to be fast to keep everything O(1).

**Morgan:** And considering the capacity limit, we need a fast way to identify which key to evict. If we keep track of the least frequently used keys, we might need a structure that allows us to quickly access the least frequently used list and identify the LRU key in it.

**Jamie:** That points toward having a minimum frequency counter that updates when we put or get keys. As for eviction, how do we decide which key is the LRU within the least frequency list?

**Alex:** That's where the ordered aspect of our list comes in. The key at the start would always be the LRU. But we need to ensure that every time a key is accessed, it moves to the end to reflect its recent use.

**Morgan:** So, if I understand correctly, for a `get` operation, we find the key, increment its frequency, move it to the end of its current frequency list, then shift it to the end of the next frequency list. For `put`, it's similar, but we might have to evict a key first if we're at capacity.

**Jamie:** Right. Eviction would mean removing the first key from the least frequency list. And adding a new key means putting it in the frequency-1 list, correctly managing the minimum frequency counter.

**Alex:** This approach should work. It allows us to handle both `get` and `put` efficiently if we implement it correctly. Avoiding unnecessary operations and keeping our data structures optimized is key.

**Morgan:** Seems like a good plan. There are a lot of moving parts, though. Implementing and testing it thoroughly will be crucial.

**Jamie:** Definitely. Once we have a prototype, we should run extensive tests, especially on edge cases, to ensure everything works as expected.

**Alex:** Agreed. Let's start by drafting some pseudo-code and identifying potential pitfalls. Great discussion, everyone. Let's make this LFU cache a reality.
