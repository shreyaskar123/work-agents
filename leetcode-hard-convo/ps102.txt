Alex: Hey, Taylor, Jamie, glad we could meet up. I’ve been wrestling with this coding problem about counting important reverse pairs in an array. It's quite the brain teaser.

Taylor: Sounds interesting, Alex. Let’s break it down. What exactly defines an important reverse pair in this context?

Alex: Good question. For any two indices `i` and `j` in the array, if `i < j` and `nums[i] > 2*nums[j]`, then the pair `(i, j)` is considered an important reverse pair.

Jamie: Ah, I see. That sounds like it could get pretty intensive to check every possible pair, especially with larger arrays. There must be a more efficient way than brute-forcing it.

Taylor: Definitely. I think a divide and conquer approach might work well here. Something similar to merge sort could be adapted, couldn't it?

Alex: That’s what I was thinking. A merge sort not only sorts the array but it could also help in checking for these pairs during the merge process.

Jamie: Right, during the merge step, we could effectively count how many times `nums[i]` is greater than double `nums[j]` for all elements in the right half. But how do we do it without compromising the merge sort’s efficiency?

Taylor: Great question. Maybe as we're sorting, we could incorporate a condition to check and count these instances before fully merging the two halves. It's crucial not to repeat comparisons to maintain the time complexity.

Alex: Exactly, and remember the array is split recursively until we have subarrays of, ideally, single elements, which simplifies the initial comparisons. This method might also require additional space to move elements around during the merge, similar to a typical merge sort.

Jamie: I see, maintaining the order and counting simultaneously. What about the edge cases, though? How do we handle an array with negative numbers or an array that's already sorted?

Taylor: Good points. Since the problem statement mentions all numbers are within the range of a 32-bit integer, we don’t have to worry about odd data types. As for a sorted array, our method should naturally handle that efficiently since it would reduce the need for comparisons.

Alex: That’s true. It all comes down to how we implement the merge step to not only sort but also to count those important reverse pairs. Careful indexing and not overlooking the `i < j` condition are crucial.

Jamie: Definitely. It sounds like a plan then. Taylor, could you sketch out the pseudocode for this merge and count approach?

Taylor: Sure, I’ll draft something that outlines the divide and conquer strategy, focusing on how to merge two sorted halves and counting the pairs meeting our conditions. Let's review it together to ensure we nail the logic before diving into coding.

Alex: Sounds good. Once we have a solid understanding, implementing it should be straightforward. Thanks for the brainstorm, team. This approach seems promising.
