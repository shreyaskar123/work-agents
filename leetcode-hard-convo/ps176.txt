Alice starts the meeting by addressing everyone present in the virtual room. "So, our main task today is to figure out a way to calculate the sum of the distances between each node and all other nodes in a given tree. The tree is undirected and connected, with `N` nodes and `N-1` edges. Each edge links two nodes together, creating the tree structure."

Bob, a team member, pitches in with a question, "Before we dive deeper, can we first discuss how to represent the tree structure based on the given edges? This will help us visualize and manipulate the tree more easily in our solution."

"Good point, Bob," Alice responds. "We can use an adjacency list to represent the tree. Each index in the list corresponds to a node, and it stores an array of neighboring nodes. This way, we can efficiently traverse the tree from any node."

Charlie, another team member, chimes in with a suggestion, "For calculating distances, how about we start with a brute force approach where we find the distance from one node to all other nodes one by one? We could use something like depth-first search (DFS) for this."

Alice nods, "That could work, Charlie, but considering the tree might have up to 10,000 nodes, wouldn't the brute force approach have a significant performance hit? Each DFS from a node would have a computational complexity of O(N), and doing it for each node would make it O(N^2)."

Diana, who has been quietly listening, finally speaks up, "What if we optimize the process by using a two-step approach? First, we calculate the distance of all nodes from a certain root node. Then, we somehow leverage that information to compute the distance sums for all nodes without having to redo the entire DFS from each node."

"Interesting idea, Diana," Alice says thoughtfully. "Could you elaborate on how we could adjust the distances without recalculating them entirely from scratch for each node?"

"Well, if we choose any node as the root and then calculate the distances of all nodes from it, we essentially have a base sum of distances for that root," Diana explains. "When we move the root to one of its adjacent nodes, the distances of most nodes will either increase or decrease by 1, except for the ones that change their 'parent' in this new rooting of the tree."

Bob, looking intrigued, asks, "So, are we talking about some sort of dynamic re-rooting of the tree where we adjust the sums based on the structure of the tree and how nodes are connected?"

"Exactly, Bob," Alice answers. "This re-rooting strategy could reduce our problem complexity significantly. But we need to figure out a systematic way to apply changes to our distance calculations as we 'move' our root around the tree."

Charlie, trying to wrap his head around the concept, says, "This sounds promising but also complex. How do we track which distances increase or decrease without explicitly recalculating them every time?"

Diana responds, "It all comes down to understanding the structure of the tree and the relationships between nodes. If we have detailed information about the tree, like the number of children each node has, we can use it to adjust our sums intelligently."

Alice concludes, "Alright, team, it seems like we have a solid direction for our solution. Let's start by implementing the tree structure as an adjacency list and experiment with the DFS approach for calculating base sums. Next, we'll work on the dynamic adjustment of sums as we conceptually move the root around the tree. Remember, our goal is to provide the sum of the distances between each node and all other nodes without directly solving it here. We're designing a roadmap, not the final code." 

Everyone in the meeting nods in agreement, ready to tackle the problem with the outlined strategy.
