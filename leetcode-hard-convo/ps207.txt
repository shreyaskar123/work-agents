**Alex:** So, let's tackle this interesting problem. Given a single positive integer `x`, the challenge is to write an expression using `x` with the least number of operations to equal a target number. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

**Jordan:** Right, and considering that division returns rational numbers, and there's an adherence to the conventional order of operations, it does get a bit tricky.

**Morgan:** Exactly. First off, we need an approach to identify the least number of operations. It's tempting to dive into complex algorithms, but understanding the patterns and constraints is crucial.

**Alex:** For instance, if we take the example where `x = 3` and the target is `19`, the solution involves a calculated use of multiplication and addition to reach the number with minimal operations.

**Jordan:** Ah, I see. So, it looks like multiplication gives us a higher number faster, but we can't just multiply all the way, especially when the target number isn't a direct power of `x`.

**Morgan:** That's a key observation. Also, remember that division can help adjust the final number if we overshoot with multiplication or need to correct the remainder.

**Alex:** Let’s not forget subtraction. It seems less efficient than addition in most cases but could be crucial in fine-tuning the expression to hit the target.

**Jordan:** True. Considering the constraint that we can't use negation, each operation has to be carefully picked. For example, when the input is `x = 5` and the target is `501`, multiplying to get close to 501 and then adding or subtracting to reach it seems logical.

**Morgan:** Yeah, and in a case with a huge target like `100000000` with `x = 100`, it demonstrates that multiplication is our best bet to keep the operation count low. 

**Alex:** This hints at prioritizing multiplication and strategically using addition or subtraction to tackle the remainder. Also, incorporating division when the situation calls for minor adjustments or corrections.

**Jordan:** So, essentially, we need to devise a strategy that maximizes the use of multiplication, with addition or subtraction to handle the excess or shortfall, and division as a fine-tuner.

**Morgan:** Correct. The solution involves iterating through possibilities, while keeping in mind the balance between reaching the target quickly and minimizing operations. It's almost strategic planning with mathematical operations.

**Alex:** To wrap up, would you say that practicing with different `x` and target values can help one understand the patterns and make strategic decisions on what operations to use and when?

**Jordan:** Absolutely, practice would definitely shed light on how to tackle varying targets with minimal operations. Plus, being mindful of how each operation impacts the overall expression is key to finding the optimal solution.

**Morgan:** So, our meeting takeaway is about developing a keen sense on when to apply each operation as we strive for efficiency in reaching the target with minimal steps. Let’s each try some examples on our own and regroup to discuss our findings.

**Alex:** Great plan! Looking forward to seeing the different strategies we come up with.
