**Alex**: Hey Taylor, Jamie, have you started looking into this problem about maximizing points by removing boxes?

**Taylor**: Yeah, I've been thinking about it. It seems like a dynamic programming problem, doesn't it?

**Jamie**: Definitely. It's all about finding the optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. I’m considering the use of memoization to handle the repeated subproblems.

**Alex**: I’ve been trying to visualize how to approach it. We’re dealing with continuous boxes of the same color. Removing them strategically could maximize points.

**Taylor**: Right, I think a 3D DP array could be beneficial here. Something like dp[l][r][k], representing the maximum points from boxes[l] to boxes[r] with k boxes of the same color as boxes[r] attached to the right side.

**Jamie**: Oh, that’s a solid approach. So, we're essentially breaking down the problem into smaller segments and solving for each, storing those solutions for future reference.

**Alex**: I’m curious about the base cases for this DP array. How would you define them?

**Taylor**: For any segment with no boxes, it's straightforward, the score is 0. When we only have one color in a segment, the solution would be simple, the square of the count of those boxes.

**Jamie**: And about transitioning between states, how do we handle that? We need a way to decide whether to combine current boxes with future ones or not.

**Taylor**: That's where recursion comes in. We'll iterate through the segment and try to remove each possible continuous subset of boxes, calculating points for the action and using the DP array to fetch the best score for the remaining segment.

**Alex**: Makes sense. We have to maximize points, so comparing the scores obtained by removing different subsets and choosing the best option is key.

**Jamie**: Exactly. Also, remember to consider when it's beneficial to leave some boxes for later, to make a larger continuous set. That’s where the k in dp[l][r][k] truly shines.

**Alex**: Ah, optimizing the removal process to account for future potential gains. Tricky but fascinating.

**Taylor**: It’s crucial to cache those results. Otherwise, the computation time will explode due to the number of possible combinations and recalculations.

**Jamie**: For sure, memoization will significantly reduce the runtime. Have either of you thought about how to handle the input and kick off the process?

**Alex**: I’d start by initializing the DP array with negative values to indicate uncomputed states. Then, kick off the recursion with the entire array as the initial segment and no additional same-colored boxes attached.

**Taylor**: And from there, let the recursive function and our DP strategy do the heavy lifting. Filling up the DP array as we compute each segment's optimal score.

**Jamie**: This problem is a doozy but dissecting it like this really helps. I'm going to draft some pseudo code based on this.

**Alex**: Same here. It’s a good strategy session, guys. Let's regroup after we have some code to discuss the implementation details and any optimizations further.

**Taylor**: Sounds good. This problem’s a puzzle, but solving it will be quite satisfying. Catch you both later for the code review.
