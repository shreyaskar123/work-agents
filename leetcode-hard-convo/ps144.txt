**Alex:** So, let's brainstorm how we might tackle parsing and counting elements in these chemical formulas. Given the examples, any initial thoughts?

**Jordan:** First thing that comes to mind is we need a way to differentiate between single elements and those in parentheses, plus handle their counts correctly.

**Casey:** Right, and considering elements can have single or multiple characters and varying counts, we'll need some form of loop to go through the formula string character by character.

**Alex:** Exactly. Let’s also consider using a stack to handle nested parentheses, which seems to be a challenge, especially with cases like "K4(ON(SO3)2)2" where we have multiple layers.

**Jordan:** Makes sense. For each element, we could update its count in a map. When we hit an open parenthesis, we push the current map on the stack and start a fresh one for the contents inside the parentheses.

**Casey:** And once we encounter a closing parenthesis, we’d multiply the counts of elements inside by the number directly following the parenthesis, if any, then merge it with the top element of the stack, right?

**Alex:** Spot on. That multiplication step is key for cases like "(OH)2" where everything inside needs to be counted twice. What about handling the sorting part?

**Jordan:** After we’re done parsing, we can just retrieve the elements from our map, sort them alphabetically, and format the final string accordingly. If an element's count is more than 1, we include the count, otherwise, we leave it out.

**Casey:** I’m thinking a regular expression could help us with identifying elements and their counts as we iterate through the string. It could simplify splitting the formula into manageable parts.

**Alex:** Good point, Casey. Regular expressions can indeed simplify the detection of element names and numbers. Meanwhile, we must be careful with indices, especially after matching a pattern, to ensure we continue parsing from the correct position.

**Jordan:** Right, and handling the optional counts after parentheses seems a bit tricky. We'll have to check if there's a number following a closing parenthesis and apply that count properly.

**Alex:** Definitely. This entire process seems to boil down to carefully managing a stack, a map for counts, and paying close attention to the parsing logic—especially around parentheses and numbers.

**Casey:** I agree. And once we have our final counts map sorted and formatted into the string, we've essentially solved the problem without directly modifying the original formula string.

**Alex:** Exactly, maintaining immutability where possible is a good practice. This approach sounds solid. Thanks for the brainstorm, everyone. Let's start drafting the code based on this strategy.
