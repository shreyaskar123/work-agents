**Jordan**: Hey, folks! Have you all had a chance to look at the puzzle about Alice and Bob's game with the stones?

**Alex**: Yes, I glanced over it yesterday. It's quite an interesting problem. It seems like a classic dynamic programming challenge, doesn't it?

**Casey**: Definitely, Alex. The key part is figuring out how each player can maximize their score, considering they both play optimally. 

**Morgan**: Right, and since each player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones at a time, we need to work out the best possible move at every turn, correct?

**Jordan**: Exactly, Morgan. What's intriguing is how the player must decide which choice leads to the best outcome by considering the future moves of the opponent as well.

**Alex**: So, essentially, we are looking at every possible move and then deciding which path offers the best outcome for the player currently making the decision. This sounds like we need a way to remember the outcomes to avoid recalculating scenarios, doesn't it?

**Casey**: Yes, that’s a crucial point. A memoization strategy should help us reduce the computational overhead. For each position in the array, we need to keep track of the best possible outcome starting from that position.

**Morgan**: I was thinking about the base cases for this memoization. For instance, when we have less than four stones left, the current player can just take all remaining stones, right? 

**Jordan**: That's a solid start, Morgan. And as we move towards the beginning of the array from the end, we simulate the choices - taking 1, 2, or 3 stones - and see which option maximizes the player's score considering the opponent also plays optimally.

**Alex**: It sounds like we’d also need to subtract the opponent's best score from the current player's score when deciding on the optimal path, since both are trying to maximize their scores relative to each other.

**Casey**: Correct, Alex. This ensures we’re always looking at the game from the perspective of maximizing our advantage over the opponent.

**Morgan**: Do you think iterating over the array backwards would make this easier, given we’re essentially looking ahead at what the opponent might do?

**Jordan**: Absolutely, Morgan. Working our way from the end to the beginning makes it easier to handle the problem since we’ll always know the optimal outcomes of taking 1, 2, or 3 stones from any given point.

**Alex**: So, once we manage to calculate the optimal outcomes for every position in the array using this approach, how do we determine the winner?

**Casey**: We simply look at the outcome we’ve computed for the first position in the array. Since Alice starts, that outcome should tell us whether Alice wins, Bob wins, or it’s a tie, based on the score difference.

**Morgan**: Sounds like a plan. I can already visualize the recursive function in my head, with the base cases and the memoization table.

**Jordan**: Awesome! The conversation we’ve just had lays out a nice blueprint. It’s all about breaking down the problem, thinking about the choices at each step, and then using dynamic programming to keep track of those optimal choices.

**Alex**: Pretty neat indeed. I'll prototype some code later today based on our discussion. It’s going to be interesting to see this solution in action.

**Casey**: Can't wait to see it, Alex. And remember, if we run into any hiccups, we can always reconvene and troubleshoot together.

**Morgan**: That’s what makes these puzzles so fun – brainstorming and then seeing our solution work. Alright, let's get to it!
