**Alex:** Hey, so I've been thinking about the problem you sent over. The one where we need to split the string into maximum number of substrings based on those conditions. It's kind of tricky, isn't it?

**Jordan:** Yeah, absolutely. I’ve been mulling over it since morning. The condition that each substring must equal its symmetrical counterpart across the center really throws in a curveball.

**Taylor:** Right, and considering we can't actually provide solutions here, why don't we try to deconstruct the problem a bit? Like, for starters, how would you even approach identifying these substrings?

**Alex:** Well, a naive approach might involve checking every possible substring combination, but that quickly becomes impractical with longer strings.

**Jordan:** True. I was thinking more along the lines of starting from the middle of the string and working outward. That way, we ensure the symmetry condition is met.

**Taylor:** That’s an interesting approach. But wouldn’t that be more viable if we knew the exact middle? What if the string length is even?

**Alex:** I think Jordan's onto something, though. Considering the symmetry requirement, maybe we don't start exactly in the middle but use a strategy that adapts as we find matching pairs that satisfy the condition.

**Jordan:** Exactly. And it’s not just about finding a matching pair, but maximizing the number of splits, remember? This part of the problem might require us to dynamically adjust as we find more pairs.

**Taylor:** Oh, that sounds like a dynamic programming problem, then. But without maintaining some form of state to remember our previous decisions, it could get complicated. 

**Alex:** Right. So, without giving away the actual code, a hint might be to maintain a structure that helps us remember our past choices? Maybe something that allows us to backtrack and see if making a different decision at an earlier stage could lead to a higher count of splits.

**Jordan:** Yeah, and considering the string could be up to 1000 characters long, whatever strategy we pick needs to be efficient. Just imagine the number of possible combinations.

**Taylor:** True. Efficiency is key. So, maybe we're talking about building some sort of table as we go? Kind of like filling in the blanks based on what we've previously encountered, ensuring we always aim for the maximum number of splits.

**Alex:** Exactly, and let’s not forget, the base case here is the simplest substring possible, which would be a letter itself. That’s a good starting point for any recursive strategy or dynamic programming approach.

**Jordan:** And regarding edge cases, we should also consider strings that cannot be split symmetrically beyond the basic single character substrings, like your example of "merchant", Taylor. It really emphasizes the need for a versatile and dynamic solution.

**Taylor:** Absolutely. I guess the starting point would involve looking at characters, finding patterns, and maybe some proof of concept on smaller strings before scaling up.

**Alex:** Definitely. Also, keeping in mind the constraints of the problem, especially the string length, would help in optimizing whatever solution we come up with.

**Jordan:** For sure. Well, I think this brainstorming session gave us a pretty solid starting point without going into specifics. Shall we try to draft up some pseudocode or basic algorithm steps based on what we discussed?

**Taylor:** Sounds like a plan. Let’s get to it and see how far we can take this approach. 

**Alex:** Agreed. And remember, it’s all about maximizing those splits while ensuring each substring meets the conditions. Let's do this.
