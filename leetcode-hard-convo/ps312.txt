**Alice:** So, how do we start tackling this problem of allocating mailboxes to minimize the total distance for houses?

**Bob:** First, we need to understand the task better. The goal is to place `k` mailboxes in such a way that the sum of distances from each house to its nearest mailbox is minimized, right?

**Charlie:** Exactly. A good starting point would be to sort the `houses` array since the houses are positioned along a street linearly. It'll make more sense to deal with them in sorted order.

**Alice:** Agreed. Next, how do we decide where to place these mailboxes? I mean, if we have multiple houses, how do we figure out the optimal position for a mailbox?

**Bob:** It boils down to finding a pattern or an algorithm that allows us to minimize the total distance. We should think about divide and conquer strategies, maybe dynamic programming to break down the problem into smaller parts.

**Charlie:** Right. Dynamic programming sounds promising. We should consider how we can divide this problem into subproblems. Maybe we can think about it as how to minimize the distance for a subset of houses first, then add more houses and mailboxes incrementally.

**Alice:** Makes sense. But don't we also need a way to remember the solutions to the subproblems we've already solved? So, we don't waste time recalculating them?

**Bob:** Yes, we should use memoization to store the results of subproblems. This way, when we encounter the same subproblem, we can just retrieve the solution from our memory structure instead of solving it again.

**Charlie:** Okay, but we also need to figure out a way to relate the solution of smaller subproblems to solve bigger problems. That's the essence of dynamic programming. It's about how the choice of placing a mailbox affects the optimal solution for the remaining houses.

**Alice:** Right. So, we should also think about the state representation in our dynamic programming approach. We need states that can encapsulate all information required to make decisions at any point.

**Bob:** True. Perhaps the state could include the number of mailboxes we have left to allocate and the position in the sorted array of houses that we're currently considering.

**Charlie:** Yes, and with those states, we can explore the different choices, essentially placing a mailbox at different points and calculating the impact on the total distance, then choosing the option with the minimum distance.

**Alice:** This is going to require some detailed implementation. We're going to need a function to calculate the minimum total distance for a given range of houses when a mailbox is placed at the optimal position for that range.

**Bob:** Definitely. Let's not forget, after we decide on the placement strategy, we must iterate through all possible ways to distribute the mailboxes to find the minimum total distance.

**Charlie:** True. Also, since we're dealing with absolute distances, there might be some math tricks we can use to optimize the calculations, especially when determining the optimal position for a mailbox for a given range of houses.

**Alice:** Yeah, analyzing some examples manually could help us uncover those tricks. It'll be beneficial to visualize the data and maybe even plot some examples to get a clearer picture of the distribution patterns.

**Bob:** Right. So, we'll need to code and test this thoroughly, considering various edge cases, especially since the constraints allow up to 100 houses and 100 mailboxes. That's a lot of possibilities.

**Charlie:** True, testing with different configurations and edge cases will be vital to ensure our solution is robust and efficient. We're aiming to minimize the computation time along with finding the minimum total distance.

**Alice:** With a plan like this, it seems manageable. Let's start by breaking this down into manageable tasks and dividing the work. We'll regroup later to merge our findings and solutions.
