**Alice:** Hey everyone, thanks for coming together today. We've got an interesting problem to brainstorm around. It’s about a grid filled with bricks where we need to simulate the effect of erasing certain bricks.

**Ben:** Sounds intriguing. Are we talking about a regular 2D grid here?

**Alice:** Yes, exactly. It’s a binary grid, with `1s` representing bricks and `0s` for empty spaces. We're given a list of hits, which specifies which bricks to erase. After each hit, some bricks might fall if they're no longer stable.

**Charlie:** What defines a brick as being stable?

**Alice:** A brick is stable if it's either directly connected to the top of the grid or if at least one of its four adjacent cells has another stable brick.

**Diane:** And we’re to compute how many bricks fall with each erasure?

**Alice:** Right, Diane. We need to return an array, where each element tells us the number of bricks that fall after applying the corresponding erasure from the hits list.

**Ben:** This sounds like a problem where the order of operations matters a lot. If you erase one brick, it could potentially affect the stability of other bricks in subsequent steps.

**Alice:** Exactly, Ben. That’s where the complexity comes in. The effect of one hit could have a cascading effect on the stability of adjacent bricks.

**Charlie:** So, for each erasure, are we looking at rebuilding the stability structure from scratch or is there a smarter way to track the changes?

**Alice:** Good question, Charlie. Rebuilding from scratch for each erasure might not be the most efficient approach, especially considering the constraints we're dealing with. We need a method that smartly tracks changes or pre-calculates stability in a way that we only need to make minimal updates as we go through the hits.

**Diane:** I'm thinking, could we possibly simulate the process in reverse? Start with the final state of the grid, then progressively add back the erased bricks, and somehow calculate stability backwards?

**Ben:** Diane, that sounds promising! By doing so, we might avoid recalculating stability from scratch for each erasure. We could leverage the final state to identify bricks that would have fallen, had they not been erased.

**Alice:** That's a brilliant insight! Working backward could really simplify things. This way, we only focus on bricks whose stability directly affects our outcome in each step.

**Charlie:** We'll need a way to efficiently check and update stability though. Maybe some form of graph or union-find data structure could help track the connections between bricks.

**Diane:** Agreed, union-find sounds suitable for efficiently merging and querying connected components, especially useful for tracking which bricks remain connected to the top.

**Ben:** And we'd also need to carefully handle bricks that were initially erased but are being "reintroduced" in the reverse simulation. They shouldn’t be considered stable until we've confirmed their connection.

**Alice:** Right. Careful management of the order in which we reintroduce bricks and check for stability is key. This could help us calculate the exact impact of each erasure in terms of falling bricks.

**Charlie:** It seems like we have a decent strategy forming. We’ll need to flesh out the details, test out our assumptions, and of course, write some code to see if our ideas hold up under the constraints.

**Alice:** Thanks for your insights, everyone. Let’s start putting our heads together on the details, outline our approach, and then divide the work. We’ve got a solid starting point, and I’m confident we can come up with an effective solution.

**Diane:** Sounds like a plan. Let’s get to it!
