**Ava:** Hey, Jordan and Casey, thanks for meeting up. I've been wrapping my head around this problem I stumbled upon about finding profitable schemes with group limits. I wonder if you two might have some insights.

**Casey:** Sounds intriguing. Is this about calculating certain combinations based on set criteria?

**Jordan:** Yes, it seems like a classic dynamic programming issue to me. Maybe we should start by defining exactly what we’re trying to find. Could you elaborate on the problem, Ava?

**Ava:** Definitely. Imagine there's a group of `n` members. We have a list of crimes, each with its profit and the number of members required. We need to figure out how many subsets of these crimes generate at least a certain amount of profit without exceeding the member limit.

**Casey:** Alright, I think I get the gist. So, if a crime generates `profit[i]` and requires `group[i]` members, we're calculating possible subsets meeting a `minProfit` threshold?

**Ava:** Exactly, Casey. And importantly, one member can’t commit to more than one crime.

**Jordan:** It reminds me of the knapsack problem but with an additional dimension for the profit. We'd likely need a three-dimensional solution to account for the group size, the minimum profit, and the current crime, don't we?

**Ava:** That’s a solid comparison, Jordan. We do approach it similarly, considering the dual constraints of group size and profit. But how do you think we’d initialize our dynamic programming table?

**Casey:** I’d assume we start with a base case, where no crimes have been committed. So, for zero members and zero profit, there's one scheme - doing nothing, I guess?

**Jordan:** Right. For implementation, would we iterate over each crime and update our DP table based on whether we choose to commit that crime or not?

**Ava:** Yes, and we’d have to update it considering both the addition to the group size and the profit. But, how do we handle the profit exceeding our `minProfit` during iteration?

**Casey:** Filtering only those schemes where the profit is at least `minProfit` is crucial, but aggregate profits beyond `minProfit` just as effectively meet the criteria, right?

**Jordan:** True. So, the DP update step would likely involve checking combinations both with and without the current crime to cover all bases, considering not to exceed `n` members while maximizing the profit.

**Ava:** Perfectly put. And since the result could be huge, we'd have to return the total count modulo `109 + 7`, dealing with large numbers.

**Casey:** Seems like we're piecing the puzzle together. What kind of sample questions could we run through to ensure we've covered all our bases?

**Jordan:** Perhaps how we deal with an array of crimes having both high profit yet requiring more members than available? It would test handling the limitations imposed by group size and profit.

**Ava:** Great point. We should also think about edge cases, like zero `minProfit`, where even schemes involving no crimes should be considered valid.

**Casey:** It looks like we've outlined a pretty solid approach. By breaking it down, we’re considering all constraints and possibilities through dynamic programming accurately.

**Jordan:** Agreed. The key takeaway seems to be the importance of accounting for every combination efficiently, especially in multi-constraint problems like this.

**Ava:** Thanks a lot, Casey and Jordan. I think I have a decent roadmap now to tackle this problem. Your insights were invaluable.
