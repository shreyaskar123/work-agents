**Alex**: Hey Jamie, have you seen this problem yet? It's about finding a specific pattern of turned-on bulbs with 'k' turned-off bulbs in between.

**Jamie**: Oh, interesting! Is this about arranging bulbs in a sequence or something?

**Alex**: Exactly. Imagine we have 'n' bulbs, all turned off initially. Each day we turn on one bulb. We need to figure out the minimum day when two bulbs turned on have exactly 'k' bulbs off between them.

**Jamie**: Sounds like a classic array problem. But how do we track the turned-on bulbs and the distance between them?

**Alex**: Good question. The input is an array where each element indicates the position of the bulb that gets turned on that day. For example, if the input array is `[1,3,2]`, it means on day 1 we turn on bulb 1, on day 2 bulb 3, and so on.

**Jamie**: Got it! So, if 'k' was 1 for that example, we'd have the right setup on the second day. Because bulbs 1 and 3 are on, with one off bulb in between.

**Alex**: Right. The tricky part is finding a way to check every day until all bulbs are on or until we find our condition, without brute-forcing it. There must be an efficient way to keep track of the order and distances between the turned-on bulbs.

**Jamie**: What if we used some sort of data structure to monitor the on/off state of each bulb, updating and checking the conditions as each bulb is turned on?

**Alex**: I like that idea. Maybe a set or something to keep track of which bulbs are on, then we could check the bulbs to the left and right each time we turn a new one on.

**Jamie**: Hmm, but we also need a way to quickly find the nearest turned-on bulbs to our current one to check if the condition meets 'k'. A straightforward approach could be too slow, especially with the constraints given.

**Alex**: True, considering the constraints are up to 20,000. Maybe we can optimize our approach by using a more efficient data structure or algorithm that handles this kind of range query or interval checking.

**Jamie**: What about keeping an ordered list of turned-on bulbs? Each time we turn on a new bulb, we insert it in order and then check its neighbors in the list.

**Alex**: Ah, that sounds promising! This way, we only check the bulbs directly adjacent in the turned-on sequence. It reduces the number of checks dramatically.

**Jamie**: Exactly. And for implementing it, we could use an efficient data structure to maintain order and allow quick insertions. Something like a binary search tree or maybe a specialized list.

**Alex**: Right. We'll also need to think through how we handle the first and last bulbs since they won't have two neighbors.

**Jamie**: Indeed. It feels like we're getting closer to a robust solution. Do you think this approach would handle all possible cases given in the problem?

**Alex**: I believe it should. The key will be efficiently managing the dynamic order of turned-on bulbs and checking the 'k' distance condition without recalculating everything on each day.

**Jamie**: Makes sense. Let's prototype this approach and run some test cases, especially edge cases to ensure we've covered all scenarios.

**Alex**: Agreed. This strategy should give us a minimal day, or `-1` if the condition never meets. Perfect, let's get started on this.
