**Jasper**: Hey, Alex, Mia, have you guys checked the latest problem we have to solve? It involves finding the number of triples of indices in an array where the bitwise AND of the values at those indices is zero.

**Mia**: Oh, I saw that. It's quite a head-scratcher. We're dealing with a problem that requires understanding both bitwise operations and combinatorics, isn't it?

**Alex**: Exactly! The bitwise AND operation isn't something we deal with every day. We need to find all possible triples (i, j, k) within an array where `A[i] & A[j] & A[k] == 0`.

**Jasper**: Right, and the tricky part is managing the time complexity. With a naive approach, evaluating all possible triples would easily lead into an O(n^3) time complexity, which could be too slow given that the array length can go up to 1000.

**Mia**: We should probably think about ways to reduce the computational overhead. Maybe there's a pattern or property related to the bitwise AND operation we can take advantage of? 

**Alex**: True. Letâ€™s recall that the bitwise AND of two numbers only returns 1 for a bit if that bit is 1 in both numbers. This simple property might greatly reduce the number of triplets we need to actually process.

**Jasper**: How about preprocessing? We could use some form of memoization or preprocessing to store intermediate results and avoid repetitive computation, perhaps?

**Mia**: Preprocessing sounds promising. Maybe we could iterate over each pair of elements first and store their AND results? Yet, I'm wondering how we efficiently use those results afterward.

**Alex**: There might be a pattern or property that we're overlooking. Remembering that the AND operation is associative could help simplify things. That means `(a & b) & c` is the same as `a & (b & c)`. We might not need to compute every possible combination directly.

**Jasper**: Another angle could be looking into the distribution of zeros and ones in the binary representation of the array's elements. High bits are less likely to be set to 1 across multiple numbers, aren't they?

**Mia**: That's a solid point. We could potentially focus on breaking down the problem based on the bit representation of the numbers. But, the practical implementation of that idea is not immediately clear to me.

**Alex**: And let's not forget the constraints. With array lengths up to 1000 and elements up to 2^16, we have to be very cautious about the space and time complexity of whatever preprocessing or memoization technique we use.

**Jasper**: Right. For our next steps, how about we each try to prototype a potential solution? We could consider different approaches: memoization, bit manipulation techniques, and even segment trees or binary indexed trees if it makes sense.

**Mia**: Sounds good. We should also prepare some test cases that could potentially break our code or expose inefficiencies. Edge cases where all elements are the same, or all are distinct with no common bits set, for example.

**Alex**: Agreed. Let's regroup tomorrow with our findings. Given the complexity, it might help to combine our approaches or insights to come up with a more elegant, efficient solution.

**Jasper**: Sounds like a plan. Let's tackle this head-on and see where we get by tomorrow. Remember, understanding the problem deeply is half the battle won. See you guys tomorrow!
