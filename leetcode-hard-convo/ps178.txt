**Elena:** So, for today's challenge, it seems like we have to come up with an efficient way to guess a 'secret' word by making the least number of calls to a function that tells us how many letters of our guess match the secret word in both letter and position. And we only get 10 tries.

**Jamie:** Right. The key here is that we need a strategy to minimize our guesses but maximize the information we get from each guess. Since we know the word list and the words are 6 letters long, we should start with a guess that could potentially give us a lot of information about the letter composition of the secret word.

**Chris:** Definitely. We need to consider the distribution of letters in our guesses. Perhaps starting with a word that has a common distribution of letters would be advantageous. It’s like we’re trying to hit as many different letters as possible with each guess, given the constraint that it must be a word in the list.

**Elena:** Also, the feedback from each guess is crucial. The function returns the number of exact matches, so after the first guess, we can significantly narrow down the list of possible 'secrets' by eliminating words that don’t share the same number of exact positions as our guess.

**Jamie:** Exactly. It becomes a process of elimination. For instance, if our first guess returns 2 exact matches, we only consider words from the list that have exactly 2 letters in the same position as our guess for our next guess.

**Chris:** Another aspect could be the selection of the initial word to guess. Ideally, we'd choose a word that doesn't cluster all its unique letters in the common positions. Spread out the variability, so to speak.

**Elena:** Yes, and considering we only have 10 attempts, it might also be strategic to think ahead about our subsequent guesses based on potential outcomes of our first few guesses. It's almost like playing chess; we need to think a few moves ahead.

**Jamie:** I think a part of our strategy could involve some sort of heuristic for choosing the next word to guess. Maybe based on the most common letters remaining in our narrowed-down list or something along those lines.

**Chris:** True. And we should keep in mind, the function could return -1 if our guess isn't even in the word list, which, frankly, shouldn't happen if we're guessing strategically since we're supposed to choose from the list. That's a good sanity check to ensure we're on the right track.

**Elena:** Definitely a point not to overlook. So, it seems like our strategy involves careful planning of our guesses, a method for narrowing down our options based on feedback, and a heuristic for selecting the most informative next guess.

**Jamie:** Right. This should give us a pretty robust framework to tackle this problem. We'll use the feedback effectively, make educated guesses, and always ensure we're moving closer to identifying the secret word with each attempt.

**Chris:** Alright, let's start coding this strategy and see how we fare. Remember, it's all about reducing our search space as efficiently as possible with each guess!

**Elena:** Agreed, let's do this! This is going to be an interesting problem to solve.
