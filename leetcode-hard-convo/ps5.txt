**Alex:** Hey everyone, thanks for joining today's brainstorming session. We're tackling a pretty challenging problem today, the "Maximal Rectangle" problem, which is about finding the largest rectangle containing only 1's in a binary matrix. Thoughts?

**Jordan:** Interesting problem! So, we are basically looking for the largest contiguous area of 1's in a given matrix, right? How do we start cracking this one?

**Casey:** First things first, we need to understand how to iterate over the matrix efficiently. There's a brute force way where we could check every possible rectangle, but that would be immensely time-consuming, especially with the given constraints of up to 200 rows and columns.

**Taylor:** Right, the brute force way seems like a trap. We need an efficient method. Maybe we could use dynamic programming or some sort of stack to optimize our checks? 

**Alex:** That's a good point, Taylor. Imagine breaking down the problem so that for any point in the matrix, we know the largest rectangle we can form up to that point. We could build from there, maybe?

**Jordan:** I remember something about using histograms. Like, for each row, we could treat it as the base of a histogram and then calculate the area for the largest rectangle in that histogram.

**Casey:** Oh, that rings a bell! It's like transforming the problem. For each row, the height of our histogram bars would be determined by how many consecutive 1's we have up to that row, correct?

**Taylor:** Exactly, and there's a famous algorithm for finding the largest rectangle in a histogram. If we can apply that concept to each row as we build our histogram, we might be onto something.

**Alex:** That's brilliant. So, it's essential we understand how to calculate the largest rectangle in a histogram to apply that knowledge here. What about edge cases, like when our matrix is all zeros or all ones?

**Jordan:** For those edge cases, our solution should naturally handle them if designed correctly. An all-zero matrix would immediately result in an area of zero, and an all-ones matrix would be detected as we calculate the histogram heights and areas.

**Casey:** And regarding time complexity, if we're efficient with how we handle the histogram calculation for each row, we should be able to keep it reasonable, even for large matrices.

**Taylor:** Agreed. It's also vital to run through a couple of examples by hand to ensure our logic holds up before diving into coding. Maybe use a simple 3x3 matrix with a mix of ones and zeros, then a more complex case.

**Alex:** Great discussion, team. It sounds like we have a solid grasp on the direction to take. Let's work on the details offline, and we can regroup to share our findings and pseudocode. How does that sound?

**Jordan, Casey, Taylor:** Sounds good! 

**Alex:** Awesome, meeting adjourned. Thanks for the productive session, everyone!
