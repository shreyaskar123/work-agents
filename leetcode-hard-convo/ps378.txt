**Alex:** Welcome everyone, let's dive right into the problem we're discussing today—finding the minimum degree of a connected trio in an undirected graph. We're given the number of nodes in the graph and an array of edges.

**Jordan:** Right, so to kick things off, we need to understand what a connected trio is. A trio means we're looking for sets of three nodes where each node is directly connected to the other two.

**Morgan:** Exactly. The first step should involve parsing the graph from the input. We need to figure out a way to represent our graph. Any thoughts on that?

**Alex:** A common approach would be to use an adjacency list since it can efficiently represent both the nodes and their connections. This would help us easily check connections between nodes.

**Jordan:** With the graph represented, how do we go about finding all possible trios?

**Morgan:** Well, we could iterate over all possible combinations of three nodes and check if they form a connected trio by seeing if all three pairs of nodes are directly connected.

**Alex:** Right, and moving forward, once we have identified a connected trio, we need to figure out its degree, which involves counting all the edges where one endpoint is inside the trio and the other is not.

**Jordan:** This is where the adjacency list representation comes in handy. We can iterate over the neighbors of each node in the trio and count the edges that extend outside the trio.

**Morgan:** Exactly. The tricky part might be ensuring we don’t double-count edges or miss any. We have to be meticulous about iterating through the adjacency list.

**Alex:** Once we've calculated the degrees for all trios, we just need to find the minimum among them, correct?

**Jordan:** Yes, that’s correct. And keep in mind, if no connected trios are found, we'd return `-1` as per the problem statement.

**Morgan:** Do we need to worry about performance with this approach? Given the constraints, it seems like this could get computationally intensive.

**Alex:** Good point. We should consider the worst-case scenario, where the number of nodes is at the maximum. However, since we’re dealing with a limited number of nodes (up to 400), a brute-force method with some optimizations might be feasible.

**Jordan:** To optimize, maybe we could precompute and store the degrees of individual nodes. This way, when we’re checking the degree of a trio, we have the information readily available.

**Morgan:** That's a solid idea. Precomputation could save us a significant amount of time during the degree calculation step.

**Alex:** Right, let's summarize our approach. We’ll represent the graph using an adjacency list, find all connected trios, compute their degrees, and finally return the minimum degree among them. For optimization, we’ll precompute the degrees of individual nodes.

**Jordan:** Sounds like a plan. Let’s get started on implementing this and chalk out any challenges we might face along the way.

**Morgan:** Agreed. It’s going to be an interesting problem to tackle. Looking forward to seeing how our solution holds up against the test cases.
