Alex: So, we have this interesting problem to solve. Given the strings `s1`, `s2`, and `evil`, we need to find the number of good strings that fall within a certain criteria. How should we approach this?

Casey: Right, the first thing that comes to mind is understanding the constraints. We're dealing with strings of size `n`, and we have a condition where the strings must not contain `evil` as a substring, correct?

Alex: Exactly. And our solution needs to handle strings that are alphabetically greater than or equal to `s1` and smaller than or equal to `s2`. Let's not forget the result must be modulo 10^9 + 7 due to the potentially large output.

Jordan: It sounds like a dynamic programming problem, doesn't it? We could possibly use a bottom-up approach to calculate the number of valid strings progressively while ensuring they don't contain `evil`.

Casey: But we also need to consider the alphabetical constraints. How do we incorporate the comparison with `s1` and `s2`?

Alex: Good point. We could iterate from the beginning of our strings and make decisions at each step, whether to match the character exactly or go below or above, keeping in mind the limits set by `s1` and `s2`.

Jordan: Don't forget about avoiding the `evil` substring. It could get tricky ensuring our formed strings don't include it. We might need to track our position relative to potentially forming the `evil` substring and backtrack if necessary.

Casey: Right. And about the modulo 10^9 + 7 constraint, it's a typical practice for preventing overflow in programming contests. We’ll just need to ensure our operations remain within bounds by taking the modulo at each step where addition or multiplication occurs.

Alex: That makes sense. So, this problem is not just about generating strings but carefully navigating our constraints. There's a depth of computation here, considering the avoidance of the `evil` string and the bounds of `s1` and `s2`.

Jordan: Indeed. Perhaps we should also consider memoization to avoid recalculating states we've already explored. Since dynamic programming is on the table, optimizing our solution with memoization seems like a logical step.

Casey: Absolutely. Remember, optimization is key in problems like this, especially given the size constraints of up to 500 for `n`. Efficient memory usage and minimizing computational steps wherever possible will be crucial.

Alex: Agreed. Let's draft an outline of our approach based on dynamic programming, incorporating these elements: tracking our current position, managing the alphabetical constraints, avoiding the `evil` substring, and implementing memoization.

Jordan: Sounds like a plan. We'll need to carefully test our solution as well, given the complexity and the edge cases, especially around the boundaries defined by `s1`, `s2`, and the placement of the `evil` substring.

Casey: Exactly. Let’s get started on this approach, focusing on clarity and efficiency. We can refine as we go and double-check our logic against the examples given.

Alex: Perfect. We've got a solid starting point then. Let's dive in and solve this problem.
