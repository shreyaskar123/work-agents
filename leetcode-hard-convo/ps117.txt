**Alex:** Hey, team. We've got a challenge today that involves creating a tag validator for code snippets. Basically, our goal is to check if the given code snippet is valid based on several defined rules.

**Jamie:** Sounds intriguing. Can you lay out those rules for us?

**Alex:** Sure. Firstly, the entire code must be enclosed within a valid tag. A valid closed tag follows the format `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`, where both the opening and closing tag names must match.

**Taylor:** So, what defines a valid `TAG_NAME`?

**Alex:** A valid `TAG_NAME` contains only uppercase letters and must be between 1 to 9 characters long.

**Chris:** What about the `TAG_CONTENT`? What's considered valid content?

**Alex:** Valid `TAG_CONTENT` can have other valid closed tags, cdata, and any characters except for a few exceptions like unmatched tags, unmatched `<`, and tags with invalid names.

**Morgan:** How do we handle cdata in the tag content?

**Alex:** Cdata is represented as `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. It can contain any characters. For validation purposes, we should treat everything within the cdata as regular text, even if it includes characters or sequences that resemble tags.

**Jamie:** Got it. Do we have any examples of what constitutes a valid or invalid code snippet?

**Alex:** Yes, consider this valid example: `<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>`. It wraps the content in a valid tag, has a valid `TAG_NAME`, and the `CDATA` is correctly ignored during validation.

**Taylor:** What about an invalid code snippet?

**Alex:** An example would be: `<A> <B> </A> </B>`. It's invalid because it's unbalanced. If `<A>` is closed before `<B>` is closed, then `<B>` is considered unmatched, which violates the rules.

**Chris:** I see. For implementation, where should we start?

**Morgan:** Handling the opening and closing tags seems straightforward. Maybe we should first focus on correctly identifying and parsing the tags and cdata sections?

**Alex:** That's a good point. Parsing the input string to separate tags, cdata, and text while considering the nested structure and special cases will be critical. We'll also need some way to validate the `TAG_NAME` and ensure the structure is fully balanced and follows the rules.

**Jamie:** Sounds like we should also account for edge cases like incorrect nesting, invalid characters within tags, and improperly formatted cdata.

**Taylor:** Considering these rules and pitfalls, perhaps we could use a stack to track open tags and ensure they properly close?

**Chris:** Yeah, and maybe a separate handling mechanism for cdata sections since they're essentially escape sequences that should not be parsed like the rest of the tag content.

**Morgan:** All right, let's divide the tasks. I'll start by drafting the tag parsing logic. Jamie and Taylor, could you guys look into the validation of tag names and content? Chris, maybe you can tackle the cdata parsing?

**Alex:** Sounds like a plan. Let's regroup after we have the initial parts drafted and see how we can integrate them into a cohesive validator. Remember, the core of this is ensuring the structure and content meet all specified rules without actually executing or evaluating the code snippet.

**Taylor:** Got it. Looking forward to seeing how this comes together.

**Jamie, Chris, Morgan:** Agreed!

**Alex:** Great, let's get started then. Thanks, everyone!
