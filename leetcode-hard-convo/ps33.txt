**Alex:** Hey, Jordan, could you help me understand how to approach a coding problem I came across? It’s about finding the shortest transformation sequence from a `beginWord` to an `endWord` using a dictionary called `wordList`.

**Jordan:** Sure, Alex! Sounds like you're dealing with a classic Breadth-First Search (BFS) problem. First, the `beginWord` starts the sequence, and you transform it step by step until it becomes the `endWord`, right?

**Alex:** Exactly, and each transformation must change just one letter at a time, with every intermediate word present in the `wordList`.

**Jordan:** Okay, let's start by checking if the `endWord` is even in the `wordList`. If it’s not, we can conclude immediately there's no valid transformation sequence.

**Alex:** Makes sense. And if the `endWord` is in the list?

**Jordan:** Then, you construct a graph where each word in the `wordList` is a node, and edges connect words that differ by just one letter. The goal is to find the shortest path from `beginWord` to `endWord`. 

**Alex:** How do I efficiently check if two words differ by just one letter?

**Jordan:** A common approach is to iterate through each word, and for each letter, you replace it with every other letter from 'a' to 'z', checking if the resulting word exists in the `wordList`. This way, you gradually build up the connections.

**Alex:** What about the case when `beginWord` is not in the `wordList`?

**Jordan:** Good point. You can initially add `beginWord` to your graph as a starting node. It doesn’t need to be in the list since it's your starting point, but by treating it as part of the graph, you simplify the process of finding the shortest path.

**Alex:** And to find the shortest path, I just perform a BFS from `beginWord` until I reach `endWord`, keeping track of the number of steps?

**Jordan:** Exactly! BFS is perfect for this because it explores all paths of length 1, then all paths of length 2, and so on. The first time you reach `endWord`, you know you've found the shortest path. Don’t forget to increment your step counter each time you move a level deeper in your BFS.

**Alex:** What if I never reach the `endWord`?

**Jordan:** Then that means no transformation sequence exists under the given constraints, and you’d return 0 or an indication that the sequence is not possible.

**Alex:** This clarifies a lot, thanks, Jordan! Seems like a matter of careful implementation now.

**Jordan:** You’ve got this. Just keep the edge cases in mind and test your solution thoroughly. Let me know if you encounter any specific issues!
