**Alex**: Okay, so the challenge we're looking at involves generating arrays with certain properties and then calculating how many of these arrays meet a specific search cost. It's quite a brain teaser!

**Jordan**: Right, let's break it down. We have three variables to consider: `n` for the size of the array, `m` for the maximum value an element can have, and `k` as our target search cost. Our task is to figure out the number of arrays we can construct under these constraints.

**Taylor**: First off, understanding what "search cost" means in this context is crucial. Could you clarify that, Alex?

**Alex**: Absolutely. The term "search cost" here refers to a certain metric we achieve after applying a given algorithm to our array. Without diving into specifics, it's a measurement of how the algorithm performs or what it yields when processed with our array. 

**Jordan**: So, knowing this, we need to think about how the properties of `n`, `m`, and `k` interact. For example, when `n = 2` and `m = 3`, and we're aiming for a `k` of 1, our solution space involves finding arrays where the numbers fall within [1, m] and meet the search cost.

**Taylor**: Correct. And from the examples provided, we can deduce that the order of numbers, their repetition, and the method of calculating the search cost significantly impact the total count of valid arrays.

**Alex**: It's quite a complicated problem when you think about all the variables involved. We need to consider how combinations of numbers up to `m` can be arranged in arrays of length `n` that result in a specific search cost `k`.

**Jordan**: Indeed. A brute-force approach would involve generating all possible arrays and then applying the algorithm to check if the search cost matches `k`. Though, given the constraints, that could quickly become infeasible.

**Taylor**: Absolutely, a more nuanced approach would likely involve dynamic programming or combinatorics, considering how we're dealing with permutations and mathematical constraints.

**Alex**: Exactly, and don't forget, the result needs to be modulo `10^9 + 7`, probably to manage the size of the output numbers. Itâ€™s a common requirement for problems involving large count calculations.

**Jordan**: Right. So, to point someone in the right direction, we'd start by understanding how to generate combinations within the `n` length and `m` value constraints, then delve into calculating the search cost for each array to see if it matches `k`. 

**Taylor**: And of course, optimizing that process so it doesn't explode computation-wise. Using memoization or figuring out a mathematical formula for directly calculating the number of valid arrays could be key here.

**Alex**: Absolutely. Keeping track of previous calculations to avoid redundant operations would significantly improve efficiency. Well, it sounds like we have a good foundational understanding and some strategies to explore.

**Jordan**: Definitely, iterative problem-solving, breaking down the problem, and then tackling each piece with efficient algorithms is the way to go.

**Taylor**: Agreed. While we didn't delve into the exact calculations or algorithms, I feel we have a strong starting point for anyone looking to solve this intriguing problem.
