**Alex:** Hey everyone, glad we could meet up. So, today we're tackling that coding challenge about finding all concatenated words in a list. Any initial thoughts?

**Jordan:** Yeah, it seems like we’ll need to check every word in the list to see if it can be formed by combining other words in the list, right?

**Taylor:** Exactly. And given the constraints, brute forcing it by trying every combination of words could really be inefficient, especially with larger lists.

**Alex:** Good point. We should consider a faster approach. What about using some sort of preprocessing on the words list?

**Jordan:** Hmm, are you suggesting we sort the list or use a hash set for quicker lookups?

**Taylor:** A hash set sounds promising. It would allow us to check for the presence of subwords in constant time. But, how do we handle the actual segmentation of a word to find those potential subwords?

**Alex:** I was reading about this technique called dynamic programming. We could use it to split a word into segments and then check if those segments exist in our hash set.

**Jordan:** Oh, like starting from the beginning of a word and progressively checking every possible prefix?

**Taylor:** Yeah, and for each prefix that exists in our word list, we check if the remaining suffix can be segmented as well. The key is to repeat this process for every starting index within the word.

**Alex:** That sounds efficient, but we'll also need a way to avoid rechecking the same segments repeatedly. Maybe we can use a memoization strategy to store results of previous checks.

**Jordan:** Right, so for each starting index in a word, we remember if we’ve already determined it can be fully segmented. That should save us a lot of redundant work.

**Taylor:** And let’s not forget the base case. If at any point our remaining string is empty, that means we’ve successfully split the word using other words from the list.

**Alex:** Great, it looks like we have a solid plan. Just to recap, we're going to preprocess the list of words by putting them into a hash set for quick lookups, then for each word, use dynamic programming with memoization to check if it can be fully segmented using other words in the list.

**Jordan:** Exactly, and we'll gather all the words that can be segmented this way. Those will be our concatenated words.

**Taylor:** It’s a plan. Let’s start implementing and see if we run into any issues.

**Alex:** Excellent, I’m excited to see how this performs. Thanks, both for brainstorming. Let’s touch base again once we have an initial version ready for testing.
